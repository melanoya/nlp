At the 2006 census, its population was 218,737, in 57,551 families.\nKhomeyni Shahr is now part of the Isfahan Metropolitan area.\nThe town was originally known as Sedeh. In the 1930s, the name was changed to Homayunshahr. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the city was renamed again to Khomeyni Shahr (meaning "City of Khomeyni"), in honor of Ayatollah Khomeini. Locals have continued to refer to the city as Sedeh. There has been an ongoing effort to rename back the city\'s name to its historical one Mehrbin (مهربین).\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is commonly believed that the original name, Sedeh (Persian: سده), is derived from Seh-dedge, meaning "three castles" in Persian, ("dedge" (دژ) means "castle"), and is linked to the formation of the town by the growth of three neighbouring castles. The three main castles of Kohan Dedge, Gar Dedge, and .... Dedge (locally pronounced kohan dedge, gar dar and ...).\nIt is commonly believed that Seh-dedge was a Sassanian military base and an old fireplace (atash gah) based on top of the mountain near the town.\nThe three main villages of Khouzan (locally pronounced Khizoon), Foroushan (the origin of Foroushan was Parishan (pari (angel) + voshan (face))), and Varnosfaderan (Venesfohoon) remain identifiable parts of the city. However, there are in fact five former villages forming identifiable parts of the town. This has led to the argument that the name may be linked to the ancient Persian festival of Sadeh.\nThe name change to Homayunshahr took place during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi. The name literally means "auspicious or august city", but Homayun was also a title of the Shah and so the name was seen as being linked with the Pahlavi dynasty. Thus, after the revolution of 1979, the city was renamed again, this time to be called after Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution.\n\n\n=== University ===\nThe Islamic Azad University of Khomeinyshahr is one of the most promising Iranian universities in various fields, especially in mechanical and electrical engineering.\nIsfahan University of Technology (IUT) is ranked as one of the best universities in Iran.\nThe city contains many historical buildings and is a good place to welcome tourists. One of the most beautiful historical buildings is Sartip\'s house located in downtown.\n\n\n== References ==', 'Neomicropteryx cornuta is a species of moth belonging to the family Micropterigidae.

The league system was 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw and additional bonus points being awarded for scoring 4 or more tries and/or losing within 7 points of the victorious team. In terms of promotion the league champions would go straight up into National League 1 while the runners up would have a one-game playoff against the runners up from National League 2 South (at the home ground of the club with the superior league record) for the final promotion place.\nThe battle for the league title was as tight as it had ever been in the division with three teams - Darlington Mowden Park, Macclesfield and Stourbridge - looking to go up in a title race that went to the very last day of the season. Stourbridge won their final game away to Harrogate via a bonus point victory meaning that the winner of Darlington Mowden Park and Macclesfield was likely to go up. In a very close game in front of a record National 2 North crowd of 3,750 at The Northern Echo Arena, Mowden Park emerged as the victors 28 - 24 against Macclesfield only for the Cheshire side to gain 2 bonus points in defeat. These bonus points meant that it was Macclesfield that went up 1 point clear of their two title rivals, returning to their former league after just one season out. Despite the disappointment of losing out on the last day of the season, Darlington Mowden Park would follow Macclesfield up into the 2013–14 National League 1 by defeating Ampthill in the north-south promotion playoff in what was a very tight game that took extra time to be resolved. The move to The Northern Echo Arena saw quite a turnaround in fortunes for the north-east side, with large crowds turning up on a regular basis (an average of over 800 per game) particularly when considering that games held at the old ground of Yiewsley Drive a couple of seasons previously saw only around 200 hardcore fans watching games. You have to spare a though for Stourbridge though, as the Midlands side would easily have achieved promotion on any other season but for the most competitive title battle in the divisions recent history.\nWhile the fight for promotion had been extremely fierce the battle for relegation was far less so. Dudley Kingswinford ended a two-year stay in the division in what was a very poor season, failing to win any games at all and only having 6 points all season from try and losing bonuses (they were the first team to lose all 30 games in the division since Manchester in 2010-11, although bonus points gave them a better overall record). Dudley Kingswinford would be followed in relegation by fellow Midlands side Bromsgrove whose 5 wins were not enough and finally by Sheffield Tigers who did better but not enough to catch 13th placed Hull. Dudley Kingswinford and Bromsgrove would drop to National League 3 Midlands while Sheffield Tigers fell to National League 3 North.\n\n\n== Participating teams and locations ==\nTwelve of the teams listed below participated in the 2012–13 National League 2 North season. Macclesfield and Sedgley Park were relegated from the 2012–13 National League 1; Chester (champions) and Harrogate (playoffs) were promoted from National League 3 North; Ampthill were promoted from National League 3 Midlands as champions and were then level transferred to the 2013–14 National League 2 South, due to an imbalance in the number of teams in the two fourth tier leagues.\n\n\n== League table ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== Round 1 ===\n\n\n=== Round 2 ===\n\n\n=== Round 3 ===\n\n\n=== Round 4 ===\n\n\n=== Round 5 ===\n\n\n=== Round 6 ===\n\n\n=== Round 7 ===\n\n\n=== Round 8 ===\n\n\n=== Round 9 ===\n\n\n=== Round 10 ===\n\n\n=== Round 11 ===\n\n\n=== Round 12 ===\n\n\n=== Round 13 ===\n\n\n=== Round 14 ===\n\n\n=== Round 15 ===\n\n\n=== Round 16 ===\n\n\n=== Round 17 ===\n\n\n=== Round 18 ===\n\n\n=== Round 19 ===\n\n\n=== Round 20 ===\n\nPostponed.

Remains of Homo erectus during the Middle Pleistocene period, has been found in North Africa. The Berbers, who generally antedate by many millennia the Phoenicians and the establishment of Carthage, are understood to have arisen out of social events shaped by the confluence of several earlier peoples, i.e., the Capsian culture, events which eventually constituted their ethnogenesis. Thereafter Berbers lived as an independent people in North Africa, including the Tunisian region.\nOn the most distant prehistoric epochs, the scattered evidence sheds a rather dim light. Also obscure is the subsequent "pre-Berber" situation, which later evolved into the incidents of Berber origins and early development. Yet Berber languages indicates a singular, ancient perspective. This field of study yields a suggested reconstruction of remote millennia of Berber prehistory, and insight into the ancient cultural and lineage relations of Tunisian Berbers—not only with their neighboring Berber brothers, but with other more distant peoples.\nThe prehistoric, of course, seamlessly passes into the earliest historic. The first meeting of Phoenician and Berber occurred well to the east of Tunisia, well before the rise of Carthage: a tenth-century invasion of Phoenicia was led by a pharaoh of the Berbero-Libyan dynasty (the XXII) of Ancient Egypt.\nIn the Maghreb, the first written records describing the Berbers begin with the Tunisian region, proximate to the founding there of Carthage. Unfortunately, surviving Punic writings are very scarce aside from funerary and votive inscriptions; remains of the ancient Berber script is also limited. The earliest written reports come from later Greek and Roman authors. From discovery of archaic material culture and such writings, early Berber culture and society, and religion, can be somewhat surmised.\nTunisia remained the leading region of the Berber peoples throughout the Punic era (and Roman, and into the Islamic). Here modern commentary and reconstructions are presented concerning their ancient livelihood, domestic culture, and social organization, including tribal confederacies. Evidence comes from various artifacts, settlement and burial sites, inscriptions, and historical writings; supplementary views are derived by disciplines studying genetics and linguistics.\n\n\n== People of early North Africa ==\n\n\n=== Pharaohs connected to Egypt by Tunisia ===\nEvidence of habitation in the North African region by human ancestors has been found stretching back one or two million years, yet not to rival those most-ancient finds in south and east Africa. Remains of Homo erectus during the Middle Pleistocene, circa 750 kya (thousands of years ago), has been found in North Africa. These were associated with the change in early hominid tool use form pebble-choppers to hand-axes.\nMigrations out of south and east Africa since 100 Kya are thought to have established current human populations worldwide. Cavalli-Sforza includes the Berber populations in a much larger genetic group, one which also includes S.W. Asians, Iranians, Europeans, Sardinians, Indians, S.E. Indians, and Lapps.\n\n"[B]y definition prehistoric archaeology is dealing with pre-written sources only, so that all prehistory is anonymous." Hence, "it is inevitably mainly concerned with the material culture" such as "stone tools, bronze weapons, hut foundations, tombs, field walks, and the like." ... "We have no way of learning the moral and religious ideas of the protohistoric city dwellers... ."\n\nRegarding the evidence of prehistory, very remote epochs often give clues only about physical anthropology, i.e., per biological remains re human evolution. Usually the later millennia progressively disclose more and more cultural information yet, absent writings, it is mostly limited to "material culture". Generally cultural data is considered a far more telling indication of prehistoric human behavior and society, as compared to only evidence of physical human remains.\nThe cultural data available about human prehistory derived from material artifacts, however, too often directly concerns "non-essentials". It is limited as a useful source about the finer details of archaic human societies—the ethical norms, the individual dilemmas—when compared to the data from written sources. "When prehistorians speak of the ideas and ideals of men before writing, they are making guesses--intelligent guesses by people best qualified to make them, but nevertheless guesses."\nPerhaps the most significant prehistoric finding worldwide concerns events surrounding the neolithic revolution. Then humans developed significant jumps in cognitive ability. The evidence of the art and expressive artifacts dating back about 10 to 12 kya show a new sophistication in handling experience, perhaps being the fruits of prior advances in the articulation of symbols and language. Herding and farming develop. A new phase of human evolution had begun. "The rich heritage of rock painting in North Africa... seem to date after the Pleistocene period... around twelve thousand years ago." Thus a period concurrent with the "neolithic" revolution.\n\n\n=== Mesolithic era ===\n\nDating to the much more recent Mesolithic era, stone blades and tools, as well as small stone human figurines, of the Capsian culture (named after Gafsa in Tunisia) are associated with the prehistoric presence of Berbers in North Africa. The Capsian is that archaic culture native to the Maghrib region, circa twelve to eight kya. During this period the Pleistocene came to an end with the last ice age, causing changes in the Mediterranean climate. The African shore slowly became drier as the "rain belts moved north". Also related to the Berbers are some of the prehistoric monuments built using very large rocks (dolmens). Located both in Europe and Africa, these dolmens are found at locations throughout the western Mediterranean. The Capsian culture was preceded by the Ibero-Maurusian in North Africa.\n\n\n=== Saharan rock art ===\nSaharan rock art, the inscriptions and the paintings that show various design patterns as well as figures of animals and of humans, are attributed to the Berbers and also to black Africans from the south. Dating these art works has proven difficult and unsatisfactory. Egyptian influence is considered very unlikely. Some images infer a terrain much better watered. Among the animals depicted, alone or in staged scenes, are large-horned buffalo (the extinct bubalus antiquus), elephants, donkeys, colts, rams, herds of cattle, a lion and lioness with three cubs, leopards or cheetahs, hogs, jackles, rhinoceroses, giraffes, hippopotamus, a hunting dog, and various antelope. Human hunters may wear animal masks and carry their weapons. Herders are shown with elaborate head ornamentation; a few dance. Other human figures drive chariots, or ride camels.\n\n\n=== Theory of mixed origin ===\nA commonly held view of Berber origins is that Paleo-Mediterranean peoples long occupying the region combined with several other largely Mediterranean groups, two from the east near S.W.Asia and bringing the Berber languages about eight to ten kya (one traveling west along the coast and the other by way of the Sahel and the Sahara), with a third intermingling earlier from Iberia. "At all events, the historic peopling of the Maghrib is certainly the result of a merger, in proportions not yet determined, of three elements: Ibero-Maurusian, Capsian and Neolithic," the last being "true proto-Berbers".\nCavalli-Sforza also makes two related observations. First, the Berbers and those S.W. Asians who speak Semitic idioms together belong to a large and ancient language family (the Afroasiatic), which dates back perhaps ten kya. Second, this large language family incorporates in its ranks members from two different genetic groups, i.e., (a) some elements of the one listed by Cavalli-Sforza immediately above, and (b) one called by him the Ethiopian group. This Ethiopian group inhabits lands from the Horn to the Sahel region of Africa. In agreement with Cavalli-Sforza\'s work, recent demographic study indicates a common Neolithic origin for both the Berber and Semitic populations. A widespread opinion is that the Berbers are a mixed ethnic group sharing the related and ancient Berber languages.\nPerhaps eight millennia ago, already there were prior peoples established here, among whom the proto-Berbers (coming from the east) mingled and mixed, and from whom the Berber people would spring, during an era of their ethnogenesis. Today half or more of modern Tunisians appear to be the descendants, however mixed or not, of ancient Berber ancestors.\n\n\n== Berber language history ==\n\nIn the study of languages, sophisticated techniques were developed enabling the understanding of how an idiom evolves over time. Hence, the speech of past ages may be successively reconstructed in theory by using only modern speech and the rules of phonetic and morphological change, and other learning, which may be augmented by and checked against the literature of the past, if available. Methods of Comparative linguistics also assisted in associating related \'sister\' languages, which together stem from an ancient parent language. Further, such groups of related languages may form branches of even larger language families, e.g., Afroasiatic.\n\n\n=== Afroasiatic family ===\nTaken together the twenty odd Berber languages constitute one of the five branches of Afroasiatic, a pivotal world language family, which stretches from Mesopotamia and Arabia to the Nile river and to the Horn of Africa, across northern Africa to Lake Chad and to the Atlas Mountains by the Atlantic Ocean. The other four branches of Afroasiatic are: Ancient Egyptian, Semitic (which includes Akkadian, Aramaic, Hebrew, Arabic, and Amharic), Cushitic (around the Horn and the lower Red Sea), and Chadic (e.g., Hausa). The Afroasiatic language family has great diversity among its member idioms and a corresponding antiquity in time depth, both as to the results of analyses in historical linguistics and as regards the seniority of its written records, composed using the oldest of writing systems. The combination of linguistic studies with other information about prehistory taken from archaeology and the biological sciences has been adumbrated. Earlier academic speculation as to the prehistoric homeland of Afroasiatic and its geographic spread centered on a source in southwest Asia, but more recent work in the various related disciplines has focused on Africa.\n\n\n=== Proposed prehistory ===\nThe conjecture proposed by linguist and historian Igor M. Diakonoff may be summarized. From a prehistoric homeland near Darfur, which was better watered, the "Egyptians" were the first to break from the proto Afroasiatic communities, before ten kya (thousand years ago). These proto Egyptian language speakers headed north. During the next millennium or so, proto-Semitic and -Berber speakers went their divergent ways. The Semites passed by the then marshlands of the lower Nile and crossed into Asia (evidently the Semitic speakers anciently present in Ethiopia remained in Africa or later crossed back to Africa from Arabia). Meanwhile, the peoples who spoke proto-Berbero-Libyan spread out westward across North Africa, along the Mediterranean coast and into a Sahara region then better watered, traveling in a centuries-long migration until reaching the Atlantic and its offshore islands. Later, Diakonoff revised his proposed prehistory, moving the Afroasiatic homeland north toward the lower Nile, then a land of lakes and marshes. This change reflects several linguistic analyses showing that common Semitic then shared very little "cultural" lexicon with the common Afroasiatic. Hence the proto Semitic speakers probably left the common Afroasiatic community earlier, by ten kya (thousand years ago), starting from an area nearby a more fruitful Sinai. Accordingly, he situates the related Berbero-Libyan speakers of that era by the coast, to the west of the lower Nile.\n\n\n== The early Berbers ==\n\n\n=== Culture and society ===\nBy perhaps seven kya (thousand years ago) a neolithic culture was evolving among a coalescence of people, the Berbers, in northwest Africa. Earlier, at the long-occupied cave of Haua Fteah in Cyrenaica, "food gatherers with a Caspian flint industry were succeeded by stock breeders with pottery." Material culture progressed, resulting in animal domestication and agriculture; craft techniques included imprinted pottery, and finely chipped stone implements (evolved from earlier arrowheads).\n\n"The food gatherers who built up the shell middens round the salt lakes of Tunisia were succeeded by simple food producers, with little change in their flint industry... described as a \'Neolithic of Capsian tradition\'. [H]ere at least native food gatherers were not displaced by immigrant farmers [from the east] but themselves adopted a food-producing economy. [In the] Maghreb simple farming culture survived very little alterred for millennia. A site with impressed pottery might date to the sixth millennium b.c. or the second."\n\nWheat and barley were sown, beans and chick peas cultivated. Ceramic bowls and basins, goblets, large plates, as well as dishes raised by a central column, were domestic items in daily use, sometimes hung up on the wall. For clothing findings indicate hooded cloaks, and cloth woven into stripes of different colors. Sheep, goats, and cattle measured wealth. From physical evidence unearthed in Tunisia archaeologists present the Berbers as already "farmers with a strong pastoral element in their economy and fairly elaborate cemeteries", well over a thousand years before the Phoenicians arrived to found Carthage.\nApparently, prior to written records about them, sedentary rural Berbers lived in semi-independent farming villages, composed of small, composite, tribal units under a local leader who worked to harmonize its clans. Management of the affairs in such early Berber villages was probably shared with a council of elders. By particularly fertile regions, the larger villages arose. Yet seasonally the villagers might have left to find the better pasture for their herds and flocks. On the marginal lands, the more pastoral tribes of Berbers roamed widely to find grazing for their animals. Modern conjecture is that feuding between neighborhood clans at first impeded organized political life among these ancient Berber farmers, so that social coordination did not develop beyond the village level, whose internal harmony could vary. Tribal authority was strongest among the wandering pastoralists, much weaker among the agricultural villagers, and would later attenuate further with the advent of cities connected to strong commercial networks and foreign polities.\nThroughout the Maghrib (particularly in what is now Tunisia), the Berbers reacted to the growing military threat from colonies started by Phoenician traders. Eventually Carthage and its sister city-states would inspire Berber villages to join together in order to marshall large-scale armies, which naturally called forth strong, centralizing leadership. Punic social techniques from the nearby prosperous cities were adopted by the Berbers, to be modified for their own use. To the east, the Berbero-Libyans had already interacted with the Egyptians during the millennial rise of the ancient Nile civilization.\n\n\n=== Shared heritage ===\n\nThe people commonly known today as the Berbers were anciently more often known as Libyans. Yet many "Berbers" have for long self-identified as Imazighen or "free people" (etymology uncertain). Mommsen, a widely admired historian of the 19th century, stated:\n\n"They call themselves in the Riff near Tangier Amâzigh, in the Sahara Imôshagh, and the same name meets us, referred to particular tribes, on several occasions among the Greeks and Romans, thus as Maxyes at the founding of Carthage, as Mazices in the Roman period at different places in the Mauretanian north coast; the similar designation that has remained with the scattered remnants proves that this great people has once had a consciousness, and has permanently retained the impression, of the relationship of its members."\n\nOther names, according to Mommsen, were used by their ancient neighbors: Libyans (by Egyptians and later by Greeks), Nomades (by Greeks), Numidians (by Romans), and later Berbers (by the Arabs); also the self-descriptive Mauri in the west; and Gaetulians in the south.\n\nSeveral ancient names of Berber polities may be related to their self-designated identity as Imazighen. The Egyptians knew as pharaohs the leaders of a powerful Berber tribe called Meshwesh of the XXII dynasty. Located near Carthage was the Berber kingdom of Massyli, later called Numidia, ruled by Masinissa and his descendants.\nBerbers together, with their relations and descendants, have been the major population group to inhabit the Maghrib (North African apart from the Nile) since about eight kya (thousand years ago). This region includes terrain from the Nile to the Atlantic, encompassing the vast Sahara at whose center rise the mountain heights of Ahaggar and Tibesti. In the west the Mediterranean coastlands are suitable for agriculture, having for hinterland the Atlas Mountains. It includes the land now known as Tunisia.\nYet the most ancient written records concerning the Berber peoples are those reported by neighboring peoples of the Mediterranean region. When the Berbers enter history during the first millennium BCE, their own points of view on situations and events are, unfortunately, not available to us. Due to the impact of Carthage, it is the people of Tunisia who dominate the early historical writings on the Berbers.\n\n\n== Accounts of the Berbers ==\nHere described are Berber peoples in the first light of history, drawn from written records left by Egyptians in northeast Africa, and mainly by Greek and Roman authors in northwest Africa. To the east of Tunisia, a Libyan dynasty ruled in Egypt; their armies marched into Phoenicia a century before the founding of Carthage. Next is described Berber life and society in Tunisia and to its west, both before and during the hegemony of Carthage.\n\n\n=== Northeast Africa ===\nEgyptian hieroglyphs from early dynasties testify to Libyans, who were the Berbers of Egypt\'s "western desert"; they are first mentioned directly as the "Tehenou" during the pre-dynastic reigns of Scorpion (c. 3050) and of Narmer (on an ivory cylinder). The Berbero-Libyans later are shown in a bas relief at the temple of Sahure, from the Fifth Dynasty (2487-2348). The Palermo Stone, also called the Libyan Stone, lists the earliest sovereigns of Egypt from the 31st century to the 24th century, i.e., the list includes: about fifty pre-dynastic rulers of Egypt, followed by the earliest pharaohs, those of the first five dynasties. Some conjecture that the fifty earlier rulers listed may be Libyan Berbers, from whom the pharaohs derived.\nMuch later, Ramses II (r.1279-1213) was known to employ Libyan contingents in his army. Tombs of the 13th century contain paintings of Libu leaders wearing fine robes, with ostrich feathers in their "dreadlocks", short pointed beards, and tattoos on their shoulders and arms.\nOsorkon the Elder (Akheperre setepenamun), a Berber leader of the Meshwesh tribe, appears to be the first Libyan pharaoh. Several decades later his nephew Shoshenq I (r.945-924) became Pharaoh of Egypt, and founder of its Twenty-second Dynasty (945-715). In 926 Shoshenq (Shishak of the Bible) successfully campaigned to Jerusalem then under Solomon\'s heir. The Phoenicians (particularly the people of the city-state of Tyre, who would later found Carthage during Egypt\'s Meshwesh dynasty), first came to know of the Berber people through these Libyan pharaohs.\nFor several centuries Egypt was governed by a decentralized political system loosely based on the Libyan tribal organization of the Meshwesh. Becoming acculturated, much of the evidence shows these Berbero-Libyans through an Egyptian lens. Eventually the Libyans served as high priests at centers of Egyptian religion. Hence during the classical era of the Mediterranean, all of the Berber peoples of North Africa were often collectively called Libyans, due to the fame first won by the Meshwesh dynasty of Egypt.\n\n\n=== Northwest Africa ===\nWest of the Meshwesh dynasty of Egypt, later reports of foreigners mention more rustic Berber people by the Mediterranean, living in fertile and accessible coastal regions. Those located in or near Tunisia were known as Numidians; farther to the west, the Berbers were called the Mauri or Maurisi (later the Moors); and, in more remote mountains and deserts to the southwest were Berbers called Gaetulians. Another group of Berbers in the steppe and desert to the southeast of Carthage were known as the Garamantes.\nDuring the 5th century BC, the Greek writer Herodotus (c.490-425) mentions Berbers as mercenaries of Carthage with regard to specific military events in Sicily, circa 480. Thereafter the Berbers more frequently enter into the early light of history provided by various Greek and Roman historians. Yet unfortunately, apart from the Punic inscriptions, little Carthaginian literature has survived. We do know that Mago of Carthage began to employ Berbers as mercenaries in the sixth century.\n\nDuring these centuries, Berbers of the western regions actively traded and intermingled with Phoenicians, who founded Carthage and its many trading stations. The name \'Libyphoenician\' was then coined for the cultural and ethnic mix surrounding Punic settlements, particularly Carthage. Political skills and civic arrangements encountered in Carthage, as well as material culture, such as farming techniques, were adopted by the Berbers for their own use. In the 4th century, Berber kingdoms are referenced, e.g., the ancient historian Diodorus Siculus evidently mentions the Libyo-Berber king Aelymas, a neighbor to the south of Carthage, who dealt with the invader Agathocles (361-289), a Greek ruler from Sicily. Berbers here operated independently of Carthage.\nCirca 220 BC, three large kingdoms had arisen among the Berbers. These Berbers, independent yet markedly influenced by Punic civilization, had nonetheless endured the long ascendancy of Carthage. West to east the kingdoms were: (1) Mauretania (in modern Morocco) under the Mauri king Baga; (2) the Masaesyli (in north Algeria) under their king Syphax who then ruled from two capitals, in the west Siga (near modern Oran) and in the east Cirta (modern Constantine); and (3) the Massyli (south of Cirta, directly west and south of nearby Carthage) ruled by king Gala [Gaia], father of Masinissa. Following the Second Punic War, Massyli and eastern Masaesyli were joined to form Numidia, located in historic Tunisia. Both Roman and Hellenic states gave its famous ruler, Masinissa, honors befitting esteemed royalty.\n\n\n== Ancient Berber religion ==\nEvidence of ancient Berber religion and sacred practices provide some views, however incomplete, of the interior life of the people, otherwise largely opaque, and thus also clues as to the character of the Berbers, who witnessed the founding of Carthage.\n\n\n=== Respect for the dead ===\n\nThe religion of the ancient Berbers, of course, is difficult to uncover sufficiently to satisfy the imagination. Burial sites provide early indication of religious beliefs; more than sixty thousand tombs are located in the Fezzan alone. The construction of many tombs indicates their continuing use for ceremonies and sacrifices. A grand tomb for a Berber king, traditionally assigned to Masinissa (238-149) but perhaps rather to his father Gala, still stands: the Medracen in eastern Algeria. Architecture for the elegant tower tomb of his contemporary Syphax shows some Greek or Punic influence. Much information about Berber beliefs comes from classical literature. Herodotus (c. 484-c. 425) mentions that Libyans of the Nasamone tribe, after prayers, slept on the graves of their ancestors in order to induce dreams for divination. The ancestor chosen being regarded the best in life for uprightness and valor, hence a tomb imbued with spiritual power. Oaths also were taken on the graves of the just. In this regard, the Numidian king Masinissa was widely worshipped after his death.\n\n\n=== Reverence for nature ===\n\nEarly Berbers beliefs and practices are often characterized as a religion of nature. Procreative power was symbolized by the bull, the lion, the ram. Fish carvings represented the phallus, a sea shell the female sex, which objects could become charms. The supernatural could reside in the waters, in trees, or come to rest in unusual stones (to which the Berbers would apply oils); such power might inhabit the winds (the Sirocco being formidable across North Africa). Herodotus writes that the Libyans sacrificed to the sun and moon. The moon (Ayyur) was conceived as being masculine.\nLater many other supernatural entities became identified and personalized as gods, perhaps influenced by Egyptian or Punic practice; yet the Berbers seemed to be "drawn more to the sacred than to the gods." Early worship sites might be in grottoes, on mountains, in clefts and cavities, along roadways, with the "altars casually made of turf, the vessels used still of clay with the deity himself nowhere", according to the Berber author Apuleius (born c. 125 CE), commenting on the local worship of earlier times. Often only a little more than the names of the Berber deities are known, e.g., Bonchar, a leading god. Julian Baldick, culling literature covering many eras and regions, provides the names and rôles of many Berber deities and spirits.\n\n\n=== Syncretic developments ===\nThe Berbero-Libyans came to adopt elements from ancient Egyptian religion. Herodotus writes of the divine oracle, sourced in the Egyptian god Ammon, located among the Libyans at the oasis of Siwa. This Libyan oasis of Ammon functioned a sister oracle to one at Dodona in Greece, according to Herodotus (c.484-c.425). However, the god of the Siwa oracle, to the contrary, may be a Libyan deity. The visit of Alexander in 331 brought to the Siwa oracle wide notice in the ancient world.\nLater, Berber beliefs would influence the religion of Carthage, the city-state founded by Phoenicians. George Aaron Barton suggested that the prominent goddess of Carthage Tanit originally was a Berbero-Libyan deity whom the newly arriving Phoenicians sought to propitiate by their worship. Later archeological finds show a Tanit from Phoenicia. From linguistic evidence Barton concluded that before developing into an agricultural deity, Tanit probably began as a goddess of fertility, symbolized by a tree bearing fruit. The Phoenician goddess Ashtart was supplanted by Tanit at Carthage.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAncient Libya\nShoshenq I\nCapsian\nBerber languages\nAfroasiatic languages\nPhoenicia\nMassylii\nNumidia\nCarthage\nTanit\nHistory of Roman era Tunisia\nHistory of early Islamic Tunisia\n\n\n== References ==', 'The 4th Centre for Combat Employment and Retraining of Personnel VVS of the Russian Air Force is a research, training, and instructional centre.

Most are native to New Guinea, but some species extend to Australia, the Moluccas, and New Caledonia. A flightless species from New Zealand is extinct. There is a single monotypic family Aegothelidae with the genus Aegotheles.\nOwlet-nightjars are insectivores which hunt mostly in the air but sometimes on the ground; their soft plumage is a cryptic mixture of browns and paler shades, they have fairly small, weak feet (but larger and stronger than those of a frogmouth or a nightjar), a tiny bill that opens extraordinarily wide, surrounded by prominent whiskers. The wings are short, with 10 primaries and about 11 secondaries; the tail long and rounded.\n\n\n== Systematics ==\nA comprehensive 2003 study analyzing mtDNA sequences Cytochrome b and ATPase subunit 8 suggests that 11 living species of owlet-nightjar should be recognized, as well as another that became extinct early in the second millennium AD.\nThe relationship between the owlet-nightjars and the (traditional) Caprimulgiformes has long been controversial and obscure and remains so today: in the 19th century they were regarded as a subfamily of the frogmouths, and they are still generally considered to be related to the frogmouths and/or the nightjars. It appears though that they are not so closely related to either as previously thought, and that the owlet-nightjars share a more recent common ancestor with the Apodiformes. As has been suggested on occasion since morphological studies of the cranium in the 1960s, they are thus considered a distinct order, Aegotheliformes. This, the caprimulgiform lineage(s), and the Apodiformes, are postulated to form a clade called Cypselomorphae, with the owlet-nightjars and the Apodiformes forming the clade Daedalornithes.\nIn form and habits, however, they are very similar to both caprimulgiform group – or, at first glance, to small owls with huge eyes. The ancestors of the swifts and hummingbirds, two groups of birds which are morphologically very specialized, seem to have looked very similar to a small owlet-nightjar, possessing strong legs and a wide gape, while the legs and feet are very reduced in today\'s swifts and hummingbirds, and the bill is narrow in the latter.\nOwlet-nightjars are an exclusively Australasian group, but close relatives apparently thrived all over Eurasia in the late Paleogene.\n\n\n== Species ==\nFAMILY: AEGOTHELIDAE\nGenus Quipollornis (fossil; Early/Middle Miocene of New South Wales)\nGenus Aegotheles\nNew Zealand owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles novaezealandiae (prehistoric; formerly Megaegotheles)\nNew Caledonian owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles savesi\nFeline owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles insignis\nStarry owlet-nightjar or spangled owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles tatei\nLong-whiskered owlet-nightjar or Moluccan owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles crinifrons\nAustralian owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles cristatus\nBarred owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles bennettii\nVogelkop owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles affinis\nWallace\'s owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles wallacii\nArchbold\'s owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles archboldi\nMountain owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles albertisi\nSalvadori\'s owlet-nightjar, Aegotheles (albertisi) salvadorii\n\nA fossil proximal right tarsometatarsus (MNZ S42800) was found at the Manuherikia River in Otago, New Zealand.

(This is a rough guess; we might want to consider doing performance evaluations after Judge comes on board.)

He rated each of the U.S. attorneys with criteria that appeared to value political allegiance as much as job performance. He recommended retaining \'strong U.S. Attorneys who have ... exhibited loyalty to the President and Attorney General.\' He suggested \'removing weak U.S. Attorneys who have ... chafed against Administration initiatives\'".\n\n\n=== August 2005 ===\nAugust 8, 2005 - the Los Angeles Times reported that the day after a grand jury subpoena of records connected to Jack Abramoff "U.S. Attorney Frederick A.

(The text to the statute (U.S.C Title 28, Section 546), and its amendments, may be found at Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy#Law references). With the revision, an interim appointee can potentially serve indefinitely (though still removable by the President), if the President declines to nominate a U.S. Attorney for a vacancy, or the Senate either fails to act on a Presidential nomination, or rejects a nominee different from the interim appointee. The change was written into the bill by Republican Senator Arlen Specter when the bill was modified in joint conference committee, reconciling the Senate and House versions of the bill.\nMarch 10, 2006 - Western Missouri U.S. Attorney Todd Graves submits his resignation, effective March 24, 2006, after being ordered to do so two months previously.\nMarch 24, 2006 - Bradley Schlozman\'s first day in office for the Western Missouri district.

Sampson states in the E-mail: "I am only in favor of executing on a plan to push some USAs out if we are ready and willing to put in the time necessary to select candidates and get them appointed–it will be counterproductive to DOJ operations if we push USAs out and then don\'t have replacements ready to roll immediately."\nSeptember 17, 2006 - Via E-mail, Miers responds to Sampson\'s preliminary plan to push out attorneys: "I have not forgotten I need to follow up on the info, but things have been crazy. Will be back in touch!"\nSeptember 17, 2006 - Kyle Sampson, Alberto Gonzales\'s chief of staff, in a memo to Harriet Miers, strongly urged using the revision to the law to bypass Congressional confirmation.

It will be counterproductive to DOJ operations if we push USAs out and then don\'t have replacements ready to roll immediately ... I strongly recommend that as a matter of administration, we utilize the new statutory provisions that authorize the AG to make USA appointments ... [By avoiding Senate confirmation] we can give far less deference to home state senators and thereby get 1.) our preferred person appointed and 2.) do it far faster and more efficiently at less political costs to the White House."\nSeptember 22, 2006 - Alberto Gonzales appointed Jeffrey A. Taylor as interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia under these USA PATRIOT Act provisions.

Bush told Alberto Gonzales that he had received complaints that some of the U.S. Attorneys had not pursued certain voter-fraud investigations. These complaints came from Republican officials, who demanded fraud investigations into a number of Democratic campaigns.

He has been with DOJ since 1990 and, at age 50, has never had a job outside of government. My guess is that he was hoping to ride this out well into \'09 or beyond. I\'ll admit I have not looked at his district\'s performance. Sorry to be raising this again/now; it was just on my mind last night and this morning."\nDecember 7, 2006 - Justice Department official Michael A.

He assured the committee that he did not intend to bypass the confirmation process and denied the firings were politically motivated. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales admits that several U.S. attorneys have been asked to resign: "No, I don\'t deny that. What I\'m saying is–but that happens during every administration during different periods for different reasons. And so the fact that that\'s happened, quite frankly, some people should view that as a sign of good management. What we do is we make an evaluation about the performance of individuals, and I have a responsibility to the people in your district that we have the best possible people in these positions."\nJanuary 18, 2007 - U.S. Attorney Daniel Bogden of Nevada announces his resignation, effective February 28.\nJanuary 18, 2007, in an opinion piece for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Jane Ann Morrison reported that "A GOP source [had indicated] that the decision to remove U.S. attorneys, primarily in the West, was part of a plan to \'give somebody else that experience\' to build up the back bench of Republicans by giving them high-profile jobs."\nJanuary 19, 2007 - Bud Cummins the recently dismissed Eastern Arkansas U.S. attorney, contacted senior DOJ officials to warn them of serious "misleading statements" about the U.S. attorney firings, especially that Gonzales had said that the Justice Department would never utilize the PATRIOT Act to install new U.S. attorneys by circumventing the Senate confirmation process. Cummins believed that Gonzales\'s testimony was incorrect because both Griffin and a senior Justice Department official had told him that it was indeed the plan to avoid a Senate confirmation for Griffin.\nJanuary 26, 2007 - Marisa Taylor, writing for McClatchy Newspapers noted that, "The newly appointed U.S. attorneys all have impressive legal credentials, but most of them have few, if any, ties to the communities they\'ve been appointed to serve, and some have had little experience as prosecutors. The nine recent appointees identified [as replacements] held high-level White House or Justice Department jobs, and most of them were handpicked by Gonzales ..." "Being named a U.S. attorney \'has become a prize for doing the bidding of the White House or administration,\' said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who is a professor at the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles."\nJanuary 31, 2007 - Harriet Miers departs from her position as the President\'s Legal Counsel, on the effective date of her January 4, 2007 resignation.

Tolman was the former Judiciary Committee counsel when Specter was chair. Tolman became a presidentially nominated, and Senate approved United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the District of Utah.\nFebruary 6, 2007 - Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He underscored that the U.S. Attorneys were fired for job performance issues, and not political considerations. He stated: "The indisputable fact is that United States attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president. They come and they go for lots of reasons." In subsequent closed-door testimony to the committee (on April 27, 2007), McNulty said that days after the February hearing, he learned that White House officials had not revealed to him the extent of White House influence and discussions on creating the list. McNulty, a few days after the February hearing, calls Senator Schumer by telephone to apologize for the inaccurate characterization of the firings. At least six of the seven had recently received outstanding job performance ratings. McNulty testified that Bud Cummins, the U.S. Attorney for Arkansas, was removed to install a former aide to Karl Rove and Republican National Committee opposition research director, the 37-year-old Timothy Griffin. Cummins, apparently, "was ousted after Harriet E. Miers, the former White House counsel, intervened on behalf of Griffin." McNulty\'s testimony that the attorneys were fired for "performance related issues" caused the attorneys to come forward in protest. There is some evidence that the administration was concerned about the attorneys going public with complaints prior to this time.\nFebruary 13, 2007 - Kyle "Dusty" Foggo and Brent R. Wilkes are indicted on 11 counts including corruption, bribery, fraud, and money laundering.\nFebruary 15, 2007 - San Diego U.S. Attorney Carol Lam\'s last day in office.\nFebruary 16, 2007 - Timothy Griffin announced that he would not seek the presidential nomination to be chief federal prosecutor in Little Rock.\nFebruary 23, 2007 - U.S. Attorney Margaret Chiara of Michigan announces her resignation, effective March 16.\nFebruary 28, 2007 - Salon reports: "at least three of the eight fired attorneys were told by a superior they were being forced to resign to make jobs available for other Bush appointees, according to a former senior Justice Department official knowledgeable about their cases."\n\n\n=== March 2007 ===\n\nMarch 5, 2007 - Michael A.

I felt pressured to get these matters moving."\nMarch 6, 2007 - Gonzales responded to the controversy in an editorial in USA Today in which he said, "To be clear, [the firing] was for reasons related to policy, priorities and management — what have been referred to broadly as "performance-related" reasons — that seven U.S. attorneys were asked to resign last December ... We have never asked a U.S. attorney to resign in an effort to retaliate against him or her or to inappropriately interfere with a public corruption case (or any other type of case, for that matter). Like me, U.S. attorneys are political appointees, and we all serve at the pleasure of the president. If U.S. attorneys are not executing their responsibilities in a manner that furthers the management and policy goals of departmental leadership, it is appropriate that they be replaced ... While I am grateful for the public service of these seven U.S. attorneys, they simply lost my confidence. I hope that this episode ultimately will be recognized for what it is: an overblown personnel matter."\nMarch 7, 2007 - After the revelations of the other firings, Thomas M. DiBiagio, the Maryland U.S. Attorney, said that he had been ousted in 2005 because of political pressure over public corruption investigations into the administration of then-Gov. Robert L.

Democratic leaders reject the offer, saying the aides should testify under oath in public.\nMarch 21, 2007 - The House Judiciary Committee votes to authorize subpoenas for Rove, Miers, Sampson, Kelley, and Scott Jennings.\nMarch 21, 2007 - Senator Dianne Feinstein Feinstein, D-California said she would inquire into whether Debra Wong Yang, the former U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, was forced to leave her job late last year. Yang had previously investigated Rep. Jerry Lewis on the use of earmarks and his relationships with lobbyists and defense contractors. In November, Yang left the DOJ to work at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, the same firm who is defending Lewis in the investigation.

Goodling was set to testify before Congress, but on March 26, 2007, Goodling cancelled her upcoming appearance at a Congressional hearing, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\nMarch 29, 2007 - Sampson appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee on to discuss the firings. At that hearing, Sampson stated that, contrary to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales\'s prior statements, the Attorney General had been involved in the final decision to dismiss the US Attorneys. "I don\'t think the attorney general\'s statement that he was not involved in any discussions of U.S. attorney removals was accurate ... I remember discussing with him this process of asking certain U.S. attorneys to resign." Sampson could not recall information asked by committee members over a hundred times.\nMarch 29, 2007 - In response to allegations to Sampson\'s testimony Gonzales stated "I don\'t recall being involved in deliberations involving the question of whether or not a U.S. attorney should or should not be asked to resign ...

Paulose stepped down from their leadership positions and back into their nonsupervisory role within the office to protest the "ideologically driven and dictatorial managerial style" of Paulose.

In a letter accompanying the subpoena, Rep. John Conyers (D), the chair of the committee, wrote "We have been patient in allowing the department to work through its concerns regarding the sensitive nature of some of these materials ... Unfortunately, the department has not indicated any meaningful willingness to find a way to meet our legitimate needs ... At this point further delay in receiving these materials will not serve any constructive purpose."\nApril 11, 2007 -The Justice Department spokesman, Brian Roehrkasse, responded to the subpoena stating that the administration would like "to reach an accommodation with the Congress" but that it might not be possible. "Much of the information that the Congress seeks pertains to individuals other than the U.S. attorneys who resigned ... Furthermore, many of the documents Congress is now seeking have already been available to them for review. Because there are individual privacy interests implicated by publicly releasing this information, it is unfortunate the Congress would choose this option." said Roehrkasse.\nApril 11, 2007 - White House spokesman stated that some of the emails that had involved official correspondence relating to the firing of attorneys may have been lost because they were conducted on Republican party accounts and not stored properly. "Some official e-mails have potentially been lost and that is a mistake the White House is aggressively working to correct." said Scott Stanzel, a White House spokesman. Stanzel said that they could not rule out the possibility that some of the lost emails dealt with the firing of U.S. attorneys.\nApril 12, 2007 - CNN reported a larger question concerning the lost e-mails: "Whether White House officials such as political adviser Karl Rove are intentionally conducting sensitive official presidential business via non-governmental accounts to evade a law requiring preservation -- and eventual disclosure -- of presidential records."\nApril 13, 2007 - documents were released in response to further Congressional inquiry that appeared to contradict parts of Kyle Sampson\'s previous testimony before Congress. Sampson said during his testimony that "[he] did not have in mind any replacements for any of the seven who were asked to resign" on December 7, 2006. The released emails showed that Sampson had identified five Bush administration insiders as potential replacements for sitting U.S. attorneys months before those prosecutors were fired: Jeffrey A. Taylor, now chief prosecutor in the District of Columbia, Deborah Rhodes, now the U.S. attorney in Alabama, Rachel L. Brand, head of the Justice Department\'s Office of Legal Policy, Daniel Levin, a former senior Justice and White House official who was listed as a San Francisco candidate, and Tim Griffin, a former aide to presidential adviser Karl Rove who was later appointed the top federal prosecutor in Little Rock. In response to this information, Sampson\'s attorney stated that these candidates were only tentative suggestions and never seriously considered. Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said the list "reflects Kyle Sampson\'s initial thoughts" and "in no way contradicts the department\'s prior statements" about the lack of a candidate list."\nApril 15, 2007 - In advance of his scheduled testimony on April 17, Gonzales publishes a statement in the Washington Post. He said "While I accept responsibility for my role in commissioning this management review process, I want to make some fundamental points abundantly clear. I know that I did not -- and would not -- ask for the resignation of any U.S. attorney for an improper reason. Furthermore, I have no basis to believe that anyone involved in this process sought the removal of a U.S. attorney for an improper reason." The Gonzales statement responded to the allegations that his previous testimony contradicted Sampson testimony before Congress. Gonzales stated: "While I have never sought to deceive Congress or the American people, I also know that I created confusion with some of my recent statements about my role in this matter. To be clear: I directed my then-deputy chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, to initiate this process; fully knew that it was occurring; and approved the final recommendations. Sampson periodically updated me on the review. As I recall, his updates were brief, relatively few in number and focused primarily on the review process. During those conversations, to my knowledge, I did not make decisions about who should or should not be asked to resign."\nApril 17, 2007 - Alberto Gonzales was originally scheduled to testify before Congress  (Link to Gonzales\'s April 19, 2007 opening statement).

Gonzales received intense questioning from both the Democratic and Republican members on the committee. Many Republicans on the committee openly criticised the attorney general and his handling of the matter questioning his honesty, competence and stating that he should "suffer the consequences" from the controversial firings. Gonzales also admitted during the testimony that when he ordered the firing of the US attorneys he did not know the reason for firing two of them. The attorney general stated that he "didn\'t have an independent basis or recollection" about the job performance of Nevada U.S. Attorney Daniel G. Bogden. With regards to Chiara, Gonzales stated, "Quite candidly . . . I don\'t recall the reason why I accepted" staff advice on why to dismiss Chiarra and only after the fact did Gonzales learn "it was a question of . . . poor-management issues." In another interesting exchange, Gonzales stated that he had approved the decision but did not recall when the decision was made. ("\'Well, how can you be sure you made the decision?\' Mr. Leahy asked."\'Senator, I recall making the decision from this—I recall making the decision,\' Mr. Gonzales replied. "\'When?\' Mr. Leahy responded."\'Senator,\' Mr. Gonzales replied. \'I do not recall when the decision was made.\') Gonzales stated more than 60 times that he "couldn\'t recall" certain incidents.\nApril 19, 2007 - After Gonzales\'s testimony to the Judiciary Committee, both Senators Leahy and Specter expressed their disappointment with the results. Both stated that they still do not have a clear explanation of the reasons the eight attorneys were fired, with Leahy suggesting that political influence was the likely explanation, and Specter suggesting that incompetence might be the likely explanation. Both Senators also expressed the concern that, either way, the controversy was undermining the integrity of the Department of Justice.\nApril 19, 2007 - The White House put out a statement saying "the president was pleased with the attorney general\'s testimony, and that he felt he answered [the] questions, and that he had admitted mistakes were made, but that he has the full confidence of the president." Leahy replied to the interviewer about the White House statement: "Well, the president has set a very low bar, indeed." CNN later reported that White House insiders thought that Gonzales had hurt himself with his recent testimony and described his performance before the Judiciary committee as "going down in flames", "not doing himself any favors", and "predictable."\nApril 23, 2007 - President Bush reiterated "The Attorney General ... gave a very candid assessment, and answered every question he could possibly answer, honestly answer, in a way that increased my confidence in his ability to do the job. ... [A]s the investigation, the hearings went forward, it was clear that the Attorney General broke no law, did no wrongdoing. And some senators didn\'t like his explanation, but he answered as honestly as he could. This is an honest, honorable man, in whom I have confidence."\nApril 25, 2007 - House Judiciary Committee passed a resolution, by a 32-6 vote, authorizing lawyers for the House to apply for a court order granting Monica Goodling immunity in exchange for her testimony, surpassing the required 2/3 majority, and immediately authorized a subpoena for her.\nApril 27, 2007 - Paul McNulty testifies in private meeting with Senate Judiciary Committee that he was not informed until after his February 6, 2007 public testimony to the committee, that there was extensive White House involvement in former Karl Rove aide Timothy Griffin\'s appointment as interim attorney for Eastern District of Arkansas, nor did he know the extent of Kyle Sampson\'s nearly year-long effort to compile a dismissal list.\n\n\n=== May 2007 ===\nMay 2, 2007 - the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales compelling the Department of Justice to produce all email from Karl Rove regarding evaluation and dismissal of attorneys that was sent to DOJ staffers, no matter what email account Rove may have used, whether White House, National Republican party, or other accounts, with a deadline of May 15, 2007 for compliance.

Gonzales provided no additional information regarding the controversy to the frustration and incredulity of many on the Committee. He "acknowledged for the first time Thursday that [other] U.S. attorneys might have resigned under pressure from the Justice Department, but said their departures were unrelated to the controversial firings of eight prosecutors last year." Gonzales testified that there was nothing improper about the dismissal or resignations of Graves, Heffelginger, or Yang. He addressed the cases of Biskupic in Wisconsin and Paulose in Minnesota. Unlike the recent hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, several Republicans came to the defense of Gonzales, including Lamar Smith of Texas.\nMay 11, 2007 - U.S. District Court Chief Judge Thomas Hogan signed an order granting Monica Goodling immunity in exchange for her truthful testimony in the U.S. Attorney firings investigation, stating that "Goodling may not refuse to testify, and may not refuse to provide other information, when compelled to do so" before the Committee.\nMay 14, 2007 - Karl K. "Kasey" Warner, said that he had concerns now that he might have been fired in 2005 for similar reasons to the other US attorneys that were fired. Warner was fired from his position in 2005 as the top as federal prosecutor in southern West Virginia during the middle of a corruption and vote-buying investigation and never told why he was fired. A spokesman for the White House stated that: "The notion that the termination was political is absolutely false ... We encourage Mr. Warner to provide the department with a written privacy waiver and we will be happy to provide you with the reason for his removal."\nMay 14, 2007 - Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty announced his resignation, to be effective in late summer 2007. He is the fourth and highest ranking Department of Justice Official to resign during the controversy, following Michael Battle, D. Kyle Sampson, and Monica Goodling. He was a United States attorney in Virginia before taking the deputy\'s job in November 2005. It was reported that friends said that Mr. McNulty realized that the furor over the prosecutors had likely extinguished his hope to be nominated to become a federal appeals court judge. As recently as March 26, 2007, McNulty had been quoted saying: "I have no plans to step down. I intend to cooperate with the Committee in anyway they choose."\nMay 15, 2007 - James Comey, former Deputy Attorney General (December 11, 2003 through August 2005), testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Ashcroft\'s acute illness, and Comey had in prior consultation with Ashcroft, had refused to recertify the legality of the wiretapping program. Comey was present at an evening visit by Gonzales and Andrew Card to the hospital bed of Ashcroft. Gonzales requested again renewed authorization of the secret wiretapping program; Ashcroft refused, and also indicated the correct person to ask was the Acting Attorney General, sitting next to his bed. Comey testified that he and a number of other senior DOJ officers were prepared to resign immediately over the issue. The story shed new light on Gonzales\'s activities and advocacy while counselor to the president, and there was renewed criticism of Gonzales\'s suitability to be Attorney General\nMay 23, 2007 - Monica Goodling appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, under a limited "use immunity" agreement, and provided to the committee a written statement that she read at the start of her testimony. In response to questions during the hearing, Goodling stated that she had "crossed the line" and broke civil service laws about hiring, and improperly weighed political factors in considering applicants for career positions at the Department of Justice. Link to Washington Post transcript of the hearing.\nMay 23, 2007 - Brian Roehrkasse, Department of Justice Acting Director of Public Affairs, stated in a press release: "Ms. Goodling\'s testimony today about asking political questions on applicants for career positions is troubling. This matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Justice Department\'s Office of Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility and we cannot comment further." Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty also issued a statement: "I testified truthfully at the Feb. 6, 2007, hearing based on what I knew at that time. Ms. Goodling\'s characterization of my testimony is wrong and not supported by the extensive record of documents and testimony already provided to Congress."\nMay 25, 2007 - Department of Justice officials disclosed that the internal inquiry into the potentially improper hiring practices of Ms. Goodling had been broadened to include the hiring of federal immigration judges. Goodling\'s written testimony stated that Kyle Sampson had advised: "Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) had provided guidance some years earlier indicating that Immigration Judge appointments were not subject to the civil service rules applicable to other career positions." These 226 civil service positions had 75 appointments during the Bush administration, and 49 were appointed since Gonzales became Attorney General. It was also disclosed that during Ms. Goodling\'s tenure, vacancies were not always posted. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said new procedures had been implemented, including the advertising of open positions, and the initial examination of applicants by the office of the chief immigration judge. The department disclosed that political consideration had been used for civil service immigration judge selection until, as a consequence of a lawsuit, department lawyers determined that political considerations were improperly a factor in past hirings. Hiring for immigration judges was suspended from December 2006 until April 2007, when a new merit-based evaluation process was initiated. Officials indicated the practice probably began in early 2004. Kyle Sampson began working at the DOJ in late 2003; Goodling became Gonzales\'s counsel in October 2005, and his senior counselor and White House liaison in April 2006.\nMay 30, 2007 - Tim Griffin, interim U.S. attorney for Eastern Arkansas resigned effective June 1, 2007.\n\n\n=== June 2007 ===\nJune 1, 2007 - Tim Griffin departs from office, after announcing his resignation May 30, 2007.\nJune 4, 2007 - A bill, number S.214 entitled: A bill to amend chapter 35 of title 28, United States Code, to preserve the independence of United States attorneys. also called Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007 was sent to President Bush for his signature.

Mercer had been Acting Associate Attorney General since September 2006; he retained his position as U.S. Attorney for Montana. Mercer had come under criticism from the chief district court judge of the Montana federal district, for his longe absences from Montana.

The Senate Committee on the Judiciary gave notice of the withdrawal as follows:\n\n"The hearing on "Executive Nomination" scheduled by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary for Tuesday, June 26, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. in Room 226 of the Senate Dirksen Office Building has been cancelled.

Concerning Oversight of the Department of Justice.\nJuly 25, 2007 - United States House Committee on the Judiciary voted along party lines 22-17 to issue citations of Contempt of Congress to White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said of the move "For our view, this is pathetic. What you have right now is partisanship on Capitol Hill that quite often boils down to insults, insinuations, inquisitions and investigations rather than pursuing the normal business of trying to pass major pieces of legislation ... now we have a situation where there is an attempt to do something that\'s never been done in American history, which is to assail the concept of executive privilege, which hails back to the administration of George Washington". Committee Chairman John Conyers said "Unlike other disputes involving executive privilege, the president has never personally asserted privilege. The committee has never been given a privilege log, and there is no indication the president was ever personally involved in the termination decisions." Having passed the Committee the motion goes to the full House, where it is unlikely to receive a vote until after Congress\'s August recess. If the motion passes the full House, the case would likely be given to the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeffrey Taylor. "The administration has said it will direct federal prosecutors not to prosecute contempt charges."\n\n\n=== August 2007 ===\nMid-August, 2007 - Bradley J.

Schlozman. Schlozman resigned a week earlier; and had bragged about hiring conservative staff for the department. Kim had distanced himself from Schlozman\'s statements, at a Senate committee hearing in June 2007.

Roberts Jr. The Senate has not acted on the nomination.\nSeptember 14, 2007 - In the morning Gonzales gave a speech remarking on his hopes and accomplishments, without mentioning the issues that led to is resignation.

Notable attendees include, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, former White House chief of staff Andy Card; Card\'s wife, the Rev. Kathleen Card, who said a short prayer at the beginning of the ceremony, former solicitor general Theodore Olson.\nSeptember 17, 2007 - Alberto Gonzales\'s term in office ends 12:01 am on September 17, 2007. Soon after departure from the DOJ, continuing inquiries by Congress and the Justice Department lead Gonzales to hire a criminal-defense lawyer George Terwilliger, partner at White & Case, and former deputy attorney general under former president George H. W. Bush. Terwiliger was on the Republican law team involved in Florida presidential election recount battle of 2000.\nSeptember 17, 2007 - President Bush announces his nomination of former circuit court judge Michael B. Mukasey to serve as Attorney General, subject to confirmation by the Senate. President Bush also announces a surprise appointment: Peter Keisler is to become acting Attorney General, superseding his previous August 27, 2007 appointment of Solicitor General Paul Clement as acting Attorney General. According to administration officials, Paul Clement took the acting AG office at 12:01 AM September 17, 2007, and left office 24 hours later. Apparently the appointment change was made the day before, on Sunday, with no consultation with Justice Department officials. The last-minute change is reported to add an additional element of uncertainty to working at the DOJ. Nearly every top senior official has resigned over the course of the Gonzales administration of the DOJ. Keisler is the Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ Civil Division.\nSeptember 18, 2007 - Peter Keisler enters office as acting Attorney General, as of 12:01 am.\n\n\n=== October 2007 ===\nOctober 2, 2007 - Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey\'s responses to Senate Judiciary Committee are received by the committee, and published.\nOctober 3, 2007 - Senator Patrick Leahy outlines in a letter to Michael B. Mukasey the issues related to U.S. attorneys, documents, executive privilege, and openness with the Judiciary Committee that Leahy desires a commitment on, during a proposed private meeting on October 16, 2007.\nOctober 4, 2007 - Senator Leahy indicates that the committee nomination hearing is scheduled to commence October 17, 2007.\nOctober 12, 2007 - Terms of those of the eleven interim U.S. attorneys appointed by Alberto Gonzales that have not been confirmed by the Senate expire today, 120 days after the signing of the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007 by President Bush on June 14, 2007. The law restored the interim U.S. attorney appointment process that had been modified in 2006 by the USA PATRIOT Act. Vacancies lasting longer than 120 days are subject to appointment of interim U.S. attorneys by that district\'s federal judges. Some of the interim U.S. attorneys with expiring terms are: Nelson Cohen, Alaska; Daniel Knauss, Arizona; Rosa Rodriguez-Velez, Puerto Rico; Jeffrey Taylor, District of Columbia. James Dedrick, Eastern District of Tennessee, was confirmed by the Senate in October. Scott Schools, is reappointed by San Francisco\'s federal judges for up to another four months for the Northern District of California. Jeffrey C. Sullivan, for the Western District of Washington state and Karen Hewitt for the Southern District of California were reappointed by their respective federal district\'s judges. Rodriguez-Velez was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in August, but Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) has put a hold on the full Senate vote for her confirmation.\nOctober 17, 2007 - Michael Mukasey appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and promises to block political meddling at the Justice Department, if confirmed as attorney general. He declined to distance himself from Bush administration policies about eavesdropping without warrants, authorized by Bush after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and calling the program the "Terrorist Surveillance Program." Democratic Senators appreciated Mukasey\'s promise to impose new rules to limit contacts between politicians and the Justice Department, a promise clearly intended to distance Mukasy from the controversy that enveloped Alberto Gonzales surrounding the dismissal of U.S. attorneys. Mukasey indicated that torture of terrorist suspects is illegal under U.S. and international law, and that there was no presidential authority to order it, and criticised a rescinded Justice Department opinion that allowed abusive interrogation techniques. Arlen Spector said at the hearing that the Department of Justice "urgently needs a restoration of integrity and honesty and independence ... We have seen a situation where there have been serious allegations of political influence, and it is very important that those matters be cleared up."\nOctober 18, 2007 - In Mukaseys\'s second day of confirmation hearings, many of the ten Democratic committee members were disturbed when Mukasey repeatedly declined to state whether waterboarding is torture. The technique s not allowed by the U.S. military, but been used by the CIA. It is widely condemned as torture by human rights groups. Members of the Committee subsequently followed up with written requests for clarification, which Mukasey provided October 30, 2007, which still did not satisfy numerous democratic Senators.\nOctober 31, 2007 - Senators Patrick Leahy and Dianne Feinstein sent a letter to acting attorney general Peter Keisler, criticising the lack of presidential nominees for vacant U.S. Attorney positions, citing of the 96 US attornerney offices, 23 positions are filled by interim or acting U.S. attorneys, 21 of which have no presidential nominee. They inquired if the open positions are being worked on. They cited the nine USAs with expiring terms on October 12, 2007: interim United States Attorneys in the District of Alaska, the District of Arizona, the Northern and Southern Districts of California, the District of Columbia, the Northern District of Iowa, the Western District of Michigan, the District of Puerto Rico, and the Southern District of West Virginia. They also cited the term of another interim appointment, in the Southern District of Illinois, set to expire the first week of November 2007. They also criticized administration use of office vacancy laws to fill offices for as long as 330 days without needing to consult the Senate:\n\nThree of these interim appointees, for the Southern District of Illinois, the District of Puerto Rico and the Southern District of West Virginia, along with those in two other districts, were appointed to be interim United States Attorneys after serving a 210-day term as Acting United States Attorney under the Vacancies Act. Acting under the guidance of what we believe to be an erroneous opinion of the Justice Department\'s Office of Legal Counsel, the Administration has been employing this misguided approach to put somebody in place for 330 days without the advice and consent of the Senate. This approach runs afoul of Congressional intent and the law.\n\n\n=== November 2007 ===\n\n\n=== December 2007 ===\n\n\n== 2008 ==\n\n\n=== January 2008 ===\nJanuary 30, 2008 - John Conyers issues a request for information to Attorney General Mukasey in advance of a February 7, 2008 House Judiciary committee hearing with the AG, about the removal of a press outlet Talking Points Memo (TPM) from the DOJ Office of Public affairs press release distribution list about October 10, 2007. TPM had been a leading press investigator and was early to publicize many aspects of the attorney dismissal controversy.

In October 2005, former U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, Thomas Heffelfinger had asked Hagen to come to Washington from Michigan, where she had been a federal prosecutor.\nNPR reported that:\nHagen received the highest possible ratings for her work as liaison between the Justice Department and the U.S. attorneys\' committee on Native American issues. Her final job evaluation lists five categories for supervisors to rank her performance. For each category, a neat X fills the box marked, "Outstanding." And at the bottom of the page, under "overall rating level", she also got the top mark: Outstanding.\nThe form is dated February 1, 2007. Several months before that evaluation, Hagen was told her contract would not be renewed.\n\nNPR journalist Ari Shaprio connected the dismissal to Monica Goodling\'s admission that Goodling had failed to observe civil service statutes in personnel decisions within the Justice Department.\nApril 13, 2008 - Neil Lewis, writing for the New York Times, reported that Gonzales has been unsuccessful in his solicitation of law firms for a job. It is extraordinary that a former Attorney General has not been welcomed into a firm, and law firm sources indicated that Gonzales\'s reputation is dimmed by his role in the dismissal of federal prosecutors, and the open criticism he received from Senators and Representatives while testifying about the dismissal of U.S. attorneys, and during his testimony about a secret eavesdropping program. Ongoing investigations by the Office of the Inspector General of the Justice Department are un-concluded at this date. His income since he left office on September 17, 2007, has come from speaking engagements. Schools such as Washington University in St. Louis, Ohio State University, and the University of Florida, who have each paid him about $30,000 plus expenses for appearances; business groups are being charged a little more.\n\n\n=== May 2008 ===\n\n\n=== June 2008 ===\n\n\n=== July 2008 ===\nJuly 28, 2008 The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General (IG) and the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) jointly issued a 146-page report describing the conclusions of the investigation by both offices. This was the second joint report issued regarding the politicization of personnel decisions. In June a report was issued about DOJ Honors Program and the Summer Law Intern Program (SLIP). The IG and Professional Responsibility offices explored allegations of improper dismissal of U.S. Attorneys in 2006, and allegations of politicilized hiring for non-political career civil service positions by senior DOJ officers. The report surveyed the activities of a number of staff members, and focused on the conduct of aides closest to A.G. Roberto Gonzales, especially Monica Goodling and Kyle Sampson; the report also concluded that White House staff was involved in a number of hiring decisions. The report concluded that Goodling\'s, Sampson\'s and other aides\' personnel actions constituted official misconduct, that was a violation of federal Civil Service laws, and DOJ policies. All but one of the DOJ officials cited in the report for misconduct have left; the report recommended that the sole official remaining at the DOJ whose conduct was reviewed in the report, John Nowacki, be considered for disciplinary action. Goodling and other lawyers cited in the report could face disciplinary action through their state bar associations for their misconduct. The issue of political evaluations of civil service hires was reported to have occurred before Goodling\'s elevation within the DOJ. Under AG John Ashcroft, the prior DOJ White House liaison, Susan Richmond, prevented the deputy attorney general\'s office from extending the term of one lawyer because Richmond believed that the position should be filled by an appointee loyal to president Bush.\nJuly 30, 2008 - The House Judiciary Committee recommended that the House of Representatives find Karl Rove to be in contempt of Congress for failing to appear in response to a supoena to testify before the committee. The committee voted 20-14 along party lines. The recommendation passes to the House for further action. The White House has asserted executive privilege, claiming that current and former presidential advisors cannot be forced to testify before Congress. The full House, voted in February 2008 to hold in contempt Joshua B. Bolten, the White House chief of staff, and Harriet E. Miers, the former White House counsel. In December 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee, voted, 12 to 7, to hold Rove and Joshua B. Bolten, the White house chief of staff, in contempt for failing to comply with the its own subpoenas. In that vote the ranking Republican, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, voted in favor of the contempt citations.\n\n\n=== August 2008 ===\n\n\n=== September 2008 ===\nSeptember 1, 2008 - On Labor Day, The Associated Press reports that a forthcoming DOJ Inspector General\'s report will describe Gonzales\'s handing of certain highest-level classified documents (also called sensitive compartmentalized information (SCI). Gonzales responded to the report through his lawyer George Terwilliger, (who served as the DOJ Deputy attorney general from 1991 to 1992); the Associated Press had received a copy of the twelve-page memorandum and its three-page addendum. Via the memorandum Gonzales admits that certain notes and documents about the NSA warrantless wiretap program (see above at March 2004), and other topics, had not been properly stored, but denies that any inappropriate exposure of the documents had occurred. The forthcoming Inspector General\'s report is one of three that are anticipated; one anticipated report in the coming months will review Gonzales\'s role in the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys.\nSeptember 29, 2008 - Attorney General Michael Mukasey announced the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the activities surrounding the nine attorney dismissals. Mukasey named Nora R.

THE NAAUSA also asked that the Obama administration refrain from dismissing U.S. attorneys until after replacements are confirmed, to enable "orderly transition."\nJanuary 21, 2009 - At the start of the Barack Obama administration, of the 93 U.S. attorneys, 54 are held by Senate-confirmed Bush appointees; 18 are career assistant USAs, performing as acting USAs; 18 are interim appointees appointed by district federal judges and 3 are interim appointees, appointed by the Bush administration (not confirmed by the Senate).\nJuly 31, 2009 - The White House announces that Barack Obama nominated four United States Attorneys, including the previously dismissed Daniel G.

He has researched the subject of alcohol and drinking for over 30 years, beginning with his PhD dissertation investigation, and has written widely on the subject.\nProfessor Hanson investigates the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on health. He has amassed a large, robust body of evidence that shows the benefits of moderate drinking. Hanson is a critic of many groups that advocate the reduction of alcohol use as the solution to alcohol problems in society; he describes these groups as “neo-prohibitionist.” \nHanson criticizes what he calls the "temperance mentality" of many groups and claims that "their tactic is to establish cultural rather than strictly legal prohibition by making alcohol beverages less socially acceptable and marginalizing those who drink, no matter how moderately."\nA critic of the 21-year age limit on legal drinking in the United States, he supports the acceptance of drinking learner permits for adults under the age of 21, analogous to driving learner permits.\nHanson has published books and over 300 other publications on alcohol and maintains three websites on the subject, none of which receives any support from the alcohol industry. His research and opinions have been reported in the New York Times and other newspapers; he has been quoted in Family Circle, Health magazine, Parade and other popular publications; and textbooks in 15 fields of study report his research.\n\n\n== Select publications ==\nCongressional Temperance Society.

It is centered along a three-mile stretch of Bardstown Road and Baxter Avenue (US 31E/US 150) and is so named because it sits atop a ridge between the middle and south forks of Beargrass Creek. The commercial area extends from the intersection of Bardstown Road and Taylorsville Road/Trevillian Way in the south, to the intersection of Baxter Avenue and Lexington Road in the north, a length of 3.2 miles. A 1/2 mile section of nearby Barret Avenue also contains many similar businesses. The residential area is separated from other adjacent areas like Germantown and Crescent Hill by the south and north forks of Beargrass Creek. The middle fork runs through Cherokee Park, and the south fork divides Germantown from Tyler Park, after flowing past several cemeteries and undeveloped forests downstream from Joe Creason Park. Due to its large collection of night clubs and restaurants, it is locally known as "Restaurant Row."\nThe grid of streets east and west of Bardstown Road are mostly single-family residences and range from working-class neighborhoods to some of the most expensive streets in Louisville, such as Spring Drive. One of Louisville\'s most famous Derby parties—the Barnstable Brown Party, hosted by Wrigley\'s Doublemint Twins Cyb and Patricia Barnstable—is held at a home on Spring Drive.\nIn 2000, the Highlands had a population of nearly 33,000.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Highlands was the last area near downtown Louisville to be urbanized, since its steep 60 foot incline above the flood plain made travel difficult, and the area showed no signs of urban development until just before the Civil War. Several notable families did own plantations in what is now called the Highlands, spurred by the Louisville and Bardstown Turnpike (today\'s Bardstown Road). The turnpike was first planned as early as 1784, but authorization to begin construction was delayed until 1819, and thwarted then by the Panic of 1819. Funds were finally allocated in 1829, with construction beginning in 1832.\nBardstown Road was originally a turnpike (with a macadamized surface), and tolls were collected at toll gates along the way. The portion of the road nearest to Louisville was free, so as Louisville grew, the first gatehouse moved further out. The earliest was at Beargrass Creek; it then moved to what is now the intersection of Broadway and Baxter, and subsequently to what is today Patterson and Bardstown, then to Eastern Parkway and Bardstown by 1873. It was at Speed Avenue by 1901, when the turnpike was sold to the city. The second tollgate was permanently located near today\'s Bashford Manor Lane and Bardstown.\nWhile the landowners were families of English descent, many of the first residents during the agricultural days were Germans, which gave the area the nickname New Hamburg. Large-scale residential development didn\'t begin in the area until a streetcar line extended to the area near the present-day intersection of Bardstown and Baxter in the 1890s. Nearby Cave Hill Cemetery (which doubled as park) and Cherokee Park provided recreation for the new residents.\nMany businesses formed along the turnpike, with residential development back off the main road. The growth would creep down Bardstown Road as the streetcar lines continued to be extended. By the 1930s, the entire area today called the Highlands had been developed. The streetcars last ran down Bardstown Road on Derby Day 1947, and were replaced by buses.\n\n\n=== Late 20th Century ===\n\nThe area would continue to thrive until the 1960s, when some of the wealthier residents left for the suburbs. The main business corridor along Bardstown Road suffered, with residents expressing serious concerns about its quality in 1974. Of particular concern was the neglected Mid-City Mall, with frequent complaints about crime and its deteriorated appearance due to lack of maintenance. Four neighborhood associations organized a boycott of the mall starting in February 1975, and partly as a result, foreclosure on the mall began in late 1976. It was placed in receivership in 1977, and the mall has been considerably improved in the following decades.\nThe cooperation that led to the boycott created a strong community sentiment that the right changes could be made along the business corridor. Many older buildings had been razed already to make space for more modern fast-food restaurants and drive-in banks, and there was concern that nothing would remain eventually of the streetcar suburb era corridor. This led to the creation of the Highlands Commerce Guild in 1977.\nThe Highlands area would begin to rebound commercially in the 1980s as antique shops and other "oddity" stores moved to Bardstown Road for the many vacant store fronts which were located right off the street and for the area\'s elegant architecture. Many young professionals were also attracted to the area for its location near downtown and amenities such as Cherokee Park and pedestrian-friendly shopping. By the early 1990s the area had become the city\'s main nightclub and upscale restaurant district, as well as the cultural center for the city\'s music and gay scene. Today many of its neighborhoods have among the highest percentage of college graduates and average income in Louisville. Neighborhood income and education levels are highest in the areas farthest from the city center, and gradually decrease heading toward downtown. The gentrification of the Highlands has also had a spillover effect on adjacent areas such as Butchertown and Clifton, as they developed their own upscale club and shopping districts.\nIn the 2000s the Highlands has continued to thrive, as several new mixed-use developments and additional restaurants have been established. An area of contention with some residents is whether there is too great a density of bars and nightclubs, particularly in the 900 block of Baxter Avenue. In 2004, some residents of the Original Highlands threatened a wet-dry vote to prevent more bars (in particular "The Monkey Wrench") from opening along Barret Avenue; they also sought stricter enforcement of rules regarding the percentage of revenue made from alcoholic sales; which is designed to prevent a high density of bars in a given area. This followed complaints of increased vandalism and crime, as well as complaints that many of the patrons were parking on residential streets. After an increase in police patrols, the problems ceased and talk of the vote ended.\n\n\n== Streetcar loops ==\n\nThe Bardstown Road streetcar line ran until 1947 and was gradually extended farther out as the neighborhood expanded. The densest commercial areas in the Highlands were located along these stops, though many of the buildings at the older ones have since been razed, and the density is less evident:\nHighland and Baxter Avenue\nGrinstead and Bardstown Road\nEastern Parkway and Bardstown\nBonnycastle and Bardstown (the loop passed through what is now the parking garage behind the Doo Wop Shop)\nDouglass and Bardstown (the Douglass Loop)\nTaylorsville and Bardstown\n\n\n== Theatres ==\nBefore the era of multiplexes, small single-screen theatres dominated.

Blackwood went to the University of Paris and then on to Toulouse to study civil law, with the direct patronage of Mary, Queen of Scots then in the French Court. In 1567-8 he was a rector of the University of Paris. Blackwood became a practicing lawyer in the Parlement at Poitiers, an appointment in the gift of Mary, awarded in 1579 after the publication of his first polemic, the De Conjunctione Religionis et Imperii. According to his Histoire (1589), Blackwood visited Mary in England.\n\n\n== Published works ==\nBlackwood\'s major work was a critique of George Buchanan\'s dialogue De Iure Regni apud Scotos, (1579), in which Buchanan had intended to justify to the forced abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots.\nDe Conjunctione religionis et imperii libro duo, Paris (1575), (Two books on the union of Religion and temporal power)\nThe Apology for Kings;\nAdversus Georgii Buchanani dialogum, de iure regni apud Scotos pro regibus apologia, Poitiers (1581) & Paris (1588)\n\nHistoire de la martyre de la royne de royne d\'Escosse, Paris (1589)\n\n\n== From DNB ==\nAfter following the study of mathematics, philosophy, and oriental languages, he passed two years at Toulouse, reading civil law. On his return to Paris he begun to employ himself in teaching philosophy. In 1574 he published at Paris a eulogistic memorial poem on Charles IX of France, entitled Caroli IX Pompa Funebris versiculis expressa per A. B. J.C (Juris Consultum), and in 1575, also at Paris, a work on the relation between religion and government, entitled De Vinculo ; seu Conjunctione Religionis et Imperii libri duo, quibus conjurationum traducuntur insidiæ nico religionis adumbratæ. A third book appeared in 1612. The work was dedicated to Queen Mary of Scotland, and, in keeping with his poem commemorating the author of the massacre of St. Bartholomew, was intended to demonstrate the necessity laid upon rulers to extirpate heresy as a phase of rebellion against a divinely constituted authority. The work was so highly esteemed by James Beaton, archbishop of Glasgow, that he recommended Queen Mary to bestow on him the office of counsellor or judge of the parliament of Poitiers, the province of Poitou having by letters patent from Henry III been assigned to her in payment of a dowry. Some misunderstanding regarding the nature of this office seems to have given rise to the statement of Mackenzie and others that Blackwood was professor of civil law at Poitiers.\nAt Poitiers he collected an extensive library, and, encouraged by the success of his previous work, he set himself to the hard and ambitious task of grappling with George Buchanan, whose views he denounced with great bitterness and severity in Apologia pro Regibus, adversus Georgii Buchanani Dialogum de Jure Regni apud Scotos, Pictavis, (1581) and Parisiis, (1588). During Queen Mary\'s captivity in England he paid her frequent visits, and was untiring in his efforts in her service.\nAfter her death he published a long exposure of her treatment in imprisonment, interspersed with passionate denunciations of her enemies, especially John Knox and Elizabeth I of England. The title of the work is Martyre de la Royne d\'Escosse, Douairiere de France; contenant le vray discours des traïsons à elle faictes à la suscitation d\'Elizabet Angloise, par lequel les mensonges, calomnies, et faulses accusations dressées contre ceste tresvertueuse, trescatholique et tresillustre princesse son esclarcies et son innocence averse. The book bears to have been printed "à Edimbourg chez Jean Nafield, 1587", but the name is fictitious, and it was in reality printed at Paris. It was reprinted at Antwerp in 1588, and again in 1589, and is also included in Samuel Jebb\'s collection, De Vita et Rebus gestis Mariae Scotorum Regime Autores sedecim, vol. ii., London, (1725).\nAt the end of the Martyre there is a collection of verses in Latin, French, and Italian, on Mary and Elizabeth. A fragment of a translation of the work into English, the manuscript of which belongs to the end of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth century, was published by the Maitland Club in 1834. The work contains no contribution of importance towards the settlement of the vexed question regarding the character of the unhappy queen, but is of special interest as a graphic presentment of the sentiments and feelings which her pitiable fate aroused in her devoted adherents.\nIn 1606 Blackwood published a poem on the accession of James VI of Scotland to the English throne, entitled Inauguratio Jacobi Magnæ Britauuitæ Regis, Paris, (1606). He was also the author of pious meditations in prose and verse, entitled Sanctarum Precationum Procemia, seu mavis, Ejaciilationes Animae ad Uranduiu se pneparantis, Aug. Pict. 1598 and 1608; of a penitential study, In Psalmum Davidis quinquagesimum, cujus initium est Miserere mei Deus, Adami Blacvodæi Meditatio, Aug. Pict. 1608; and of miscellaneous poems, Varii generis Poemata, Pictavis, 1609. He died in 1613, and was buried in the St. Porcharius church at Poictiers, where a marble monument was erected to his memory. By his marriage to Catherine Courtinier, daughter of the procureur de roi of Poitiers, he left four sons and seven daughters. His collected works in Latin and French appeared at Paris in 1644, with a life and eulogistic notice by Gabriel Naudé. The volume contains an engraved portrait of the author by Picart, in his official robes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

September 30, 2014, through Reprise Records. Recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles, the album includes new versions of demos that Nicks primarily recorded between 1969 and 1987, though two songs date back to 1994 and 1995. There is one cover on the album, "Carousel", a song originally written and performed by Vanessa Carlton on her album Rabbits on the Run (2011). Nicks put it on the album because it was her mother\'s favorite song in her last days and Carlton was present during her death. Nicks was inspired to record the album after her assistant showed her bootlegs on YouTube of the demos Nicks had recorded over the years. Included on the album is "Blue Water", a song that features Lady Antebellum on vocals.\nOn October 15, 2014, Billboard announced that the album had sold 33,000 copies in its first week of release and debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200, giving Nicks her sixth top ten album on that chart. The album has since sold over 100,000 copies in the US.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Album ===\nThe album was released as standard and deluxe editions. The standard edition contains 14 tracks and features several previously unpublished polaroid photos of Nicks throughout her career. The limited quantity deluxe edition features a different track list order with two bonus tracks ("Twisted" and "Watch Chain") in addition to a full color 48-page photo book of never-before-released photos. The set was also released on vinyl with the deluxe edition track listing on two 125-gram LPs housed in a gatefold package.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nThe album produced three #1 US iTunes Rock Singles. Several promotional singles were made available for download from the album prior to its release. "The Dealer", was released on August 5, 2014, followed by "Lady" on August 25, "Starshine", on September 16, and the title track on September 23, 2014.\n\n\n=== Other songs ===\nOn April 1, 2014, several months before the album\'s release, Nicks released "Golden", a duet with Lady Antebellum.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault received mostly positive reviews from music critics upon its release. At Metacritic, the album has received a Metascore of 73 out of 100 based on 11 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews."\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album four and a half stars out of five and calls it "the best-sounding record she\'s made since 1983\'s The Wild Heart." Writing for New York Daily News, Jim Farber gave the album three stars out of five and states: "We get pure Stevie — needier than some might find comfortable, but also unexpectedly wise. It’s too much for the casual listener but catnip for the devoted."\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 at #7 with sales of 33,000 giving Nicks her sixth top 10 album. The album also debuted on the UK Albums chart at #14 with sales of 5,508, giving Nicks her fifth UK Top 20 album.\nStevie made various TV appearances including the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon where she performed Lady.\nThe album has sold approximately 15,000 copies in the UK and 100,000 copies in the US.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMain Performers\nStevie Nicks – vocals, keyboards\nSharon Celani – backing vocals\nLori Nicks – backing vocals\nDave Stewart – guitar\nWaddy Wachtel – guitar, backing vocals\nSession Musicians\nVanessa Carlton – backing vocals on "Carousel"\nJessica Nicks – backing vocals on "Carousel"\nLady Antebellum – backing vocals on "Blue Water"\nMichael Campbell – guitar on "Starshine" and "I Don\'t Care"\nDavey Johnstone – guitar on "Belle Fleur" and "If You Were My Love"\nAnn Marie Calhoun – violin on "Carousel"\nTom Bukovac – guitar\nMichael Rhodes – bass\nKieran Kiely – accordion, ethnic flutes / whistles\nDan Dugmore – banjo\nChad Cromwell – drums\nBenmont Tench – keyboards, piano\nLenny Castro – percussion\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==', 'The Curtiss SB2C Helldiver was a carrier-based dive bomber aircraft produced for the United States Navy during World War II. It replaced the Douglas SBD Dauntless in US Navy service. The SB2C was much faster than the SBD it replaced.\nCrew nicknames for the aircraft included the Big-Tailed Beast (or just the derogatory Beast), Two-Cee and Son-of-a-Bitch 2nd Class (after its designation and partly because of its reputation for having difficult handling characteristics). Neither pilots nor aircraft carrier captains seemed to like it.\nDelays marred its production—by the time the A-25 Shrike variant for the USAAF was deployed in late 1943, the Army Air Forces no longer had a need for a thoroughbred dive bomber. Poor handling of the aircraft was another factor that hampered its service introductions; both the British Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force cancelled substantial orders.\nThe Truman Committee investigated Helldiver production and turned in a scathing report, which eventually led to the beginning of the end for Curtiss. Problems with the Helldiver were eventually ironed out, and in spite of its early problems, the aircraft was flown through the last two years of the Pacific War with a fine combat record.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\n\nThe Helldiver was developed to replace the Douglas SBD Dauntless. It was a much larger aircraft, able to operate from the latest aircraft carriers and carry a considerable array of armament. It featured an internal bomb bay that reduced drag when carrying heavy ordnance. Saddled with demanding requirements set forth by both the U.S. Marines and United States Army Air Forces, the manufacturer incorporated features of a "multi-role" aircraft into the design.\nThe Model XSB2C-1 prototype initially suffered teething problems connected to its Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone engine and three-bladed propeller; further concerns included structural weaknesses, poor handling, directional instability and bad stall characteristics. In 1939, a student brought a model of the new Curtiss XSB2C-1 to the MIT wind tunnel. Professor of Aeronautical Engineering Otto C. Koppen was quoted as saying, "if they build more than one of these, they are crazy". He was referring to controllability issues with the small vertical tail.\nThe first prototype made its maiden flight on 18 December 1940. It crashed on 8 February 1941 when its engine failed on approach, but Curtiss was asked to rebuild it. The fuselage was lengthened and a larger tail was fitted, while an autopilot was fitted to help the poor stability. The revised prototype flew again on 20 October 1941, but was destroyed when its wing failed during diving tests on 21 December 1941.\nLarge-scale production had already been ordered on 29 November 1940, but a large number of modifications were specified for the production model. Fin and rudder area were increased, fuel capacity was increased, self-sealing fuel tanks were added and the fixed armament was doubled to four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in the wings, compared with the prototype\'s two cowling guns. The SB2C-2 was built with larger fuel tanks, improving its range considerably.\nThe program suffered so many delays that the Grumman TBF Avenger entered service before the Helldiver, even though the Avenger had begun its development two years later. Nevertheless, production tempo accelerated with production at Columbus, Ohio and two Canadian factories: Fairchild Aircraft Ltd. (Canada), which produced 300 (under the designations XSBF-l, SBF-l, SBF-3 and SBF-4E), and Canadian Car and Foundry, which built 894 (designated SBW-l, SBW-3, SBW-4, SBW-4E and SBW-5), these models being respectively equivalent to their Curtiss-built counterparts. A total of 7,140 SB2Cs were produced in World War II.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\n\n\n=== U.S. Navy ===\nThe U.S. Navy would not accept the SB2C until 880 modifications to the design and the changes on the production line had been made, delaying the Curtiss Helldiver\'s combat debut until 11 November 1943 with squadron VB-17 on Bunker Hill, when they attacked the Japanese-held port of Rabaul on the island of New Britain, north of Papua New Guinea. The first version of the SB2C-1 was kept stateside for training, its various development problems leading to only 200 being built. The first deployment model was the SB2C-1C. The SB2C-1 could deploy slats mechanically linked with landing gear actuators, that extended from the outer third of the wing leading edge to aid lateral control at low speeds. The early prognosis of the "Beast" was unfavourable; it was strongly disliked by aircrews due to its size, weight, and reduced range compared to the SBD it replaced.\nIn the Battle of the Philippine Sea, 45 Helldivers were lost because they ran out of fuel returning to their carriers.\nAmong its major faults, the Helldiver was underpowered, had a shorter range than the SBD, was equipped with an unreliable electrical system, and was often poorly manufactured. The Curtiss-Electric propeller and the complex hydraulic system had frequent maintenance problems. One of the faults remaining with the aircraft through its operational life was poor longitudinal stability, resulting from a fuselage that was too short due to the necessity of fitting on to aircraft carrier elevators. The Helldiver\'s aileron response was also poor and handling suffered greatly under 90 kn (100 mph; 170 km/h) airspeed; since the speed of approach to land on a carrier was supposed to be 85 kn (98 mph; 157 km/h), this proved problematic. The 880 changes demanded by the Navy and modification of the aircraft to its combat role resulted in a 42% weight increase, explaining much of the problem.\nThe solution to these problems began with the introduction of the SB2C-3 beginning in 1944, which used the R-2600-20 Twin Cyclone engine with 1,900 hp (1,400 kW) and Curtiss\' four-bladed propeller. This substantially solved the chronic lack of power that had plagued the aircraft. The Helldivers would participate in battles over the Marianas, Philippines (partly responsible for sinking the battleship Musashi), Taiwan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa (in the sinking of the battleship Yamato). They were also used in the 1945 attacks on the Ryuku Islands and the Japanese home island of Honshū in tactical attacks on airfields, communications and shipping. They were also used extensively in patrols during the period between the dropping of the atomic bombs and the official Japanese surrender, and in the immediate pre-occupation period.\nAn oddity of the SB2Cs with 1942 to 1943-style tricolor camouflage was that the undersides of the outer wing panels carried dark topside camouflage because the undersurfaces were visible from above when the wings were folded.\nIn operational experience, it was found that the U.S. Navy\'s Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair fighters were able to carry an equally heavy bomb load against ground targets and were vastly more capable of defending themselves against enemy fighters. The Helldiver, however, could still deliver ordnance with more precision against specific targets and its two-seat configuration permitted a second set of eyes. A Helldiver also has a significant advantage in range over a fighter while carrying a bombload, which is extremely important in naval operations.\nThe advent of air-to-ground rockets ensured that the SB2C was the last purpose-built dive bomber produced. Rockets allowed precision attack against surface naval and land targets, while avoiding the stresses of near-vertical dives and the demanding performance requirements that they placed on dive bombers \n\nThe SB2C remained in active postwar service in active duty US Navy squadrons until 1947 and in Naval Reserve aviation units until 1950. Surplus aircraft were sold to the naval air forces of France, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Thailand. Greek SB2Cs served in combat in the Greek Civil War with additional machine guns mounted in wing pods. French SB2Cs flew in the First Indochina War from 1951 to 1954.\n\n\n=== Army service ===\nBuilt at Curtiss\' St. Louis plant, 900 aircraft were ordered by the USAAF under the designation A-25A Shrike. The first ten aircraft had folding wings, while the remainder of the production order omitted this unnecessary feature. Many other changes distinguished the A-25A, including larger main wheels, a pneumatic tailwheel, ring and bead gunsight, longer exhaust stubs, and other Army-specified radio equipment. By late 1943, when the A-25A was being introduced, the USAAF no longer had a role for the dive bomber, as fighter aircraft such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt had shown their ability to carry out tactical air support missions with great success.\nAfter offering the Shrike to Australia, only ten were accepted before the Royal Australian Air Force rejected the remainder of the order, forcing the USAAF to send 410 to the U.S. Marines. The A-25As were converted to the SB2C-1 standard, but the Marine SB2C-1 variant never saw combat, being used primarily as trainers. The remaining A-25As were similarly employed as trainers and target tugs.\n\n\n=== British service ===\nA comparable scenario accompanied the Helldiver\'s service with the British. A total of 26 aircraft, out of 450 ordered, were delivered to the Royal Navy\'s Fleet Air Arm, where they were known as the Helldiver I. After unsatisfactory tests that pinpointed "appalling handling", none of the British Helldivers were used in action.\n\n\n=== Greek service ===\n\nAmerican aid provided the Royal Hellenic Air Force with 42 Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers from surplus U.S. Navy stocks. In the spring of 1949, the aircraft were given to 336th Fighter Squadron (336 Μοίρα Διώξεως) to replace Supermarine Spitfires and the squadron\'s name was changed to 336th Bomber Squadron (336 Μοίρα Βομβαρδισμού).\nGreek SB2C-5 Helldivers had minor changes for their COIN operations: the hard rubber tailwheel (for carrier use) was replaced by a bigger pneumatic tire for use on landing strips; and the rear gunner station and its twin MGs were deleted, as no aerial opposition existed and weight reduction was used for bombs and extra machine guns.\nCurtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers, Supermarine Spitfires and North American T-6D/Gs were used in ground-attack missions against Communist ground forces, camps and transports during the last stages of the Greek Civil War.\nCurtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers saw a relatively brief combat service and were gradually phased out by 1953. A few were in use until 1957 as photographic aircraft. One Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver was restored in 1997 and is displayed in the Hellenic Air Force Museum.\n\n\n=== French service ===\nBetween 1949 and 1954, France bought 110 SB2C-5 Helldiver aircraft to replace their aging SBD-5 Dauntless that had been flying in combat in Vietnam.

The Helldiver is covered in coral and is missing its tail section. The aircraft experienced problems with its empennage after dive bombing maneuvers which forced pilot Lieutenant William Dill to ditch. It lies in 50 ft of water facing east. The site, which is protected under state and federal law, is in the process of being marked with a plaque by the U.S. Navy. A mooring may be installed at a later point in time to facilitate dives on the site.\nOn 25 March 2010, the Oregon State Police, Tillamook County Sheriff\'s Office and the United States Navy announced that during a logging operation near Rockaway Beach, Oregon, the wreck of an SB2C Helldiver was located.

He wrote also A Narrative of Troubles with the Indians (Boston, 1677), which for years was popular in New England and was even reprinted at the beginning of the nineteenth century at Worcester, Massachusetts (1801) and Roxbury, Massachusetts (1805). It is full of errors, but illustrates what was regarded by the writer\'s contemporaries as an elegant prose style. Minor works are a volume of sermons (1684) and a short pamphlet, Testimony of the Order of the Gospel in Churches (1701).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorks by or about William Hubbard in libraries (WorldCat catalog)\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gilman, D.

New York: Dodd, Mead.', 'Afghan National Civil Order Police (ANCOP) is a special police unit developed in July 2006 by Colonel Jack Stankiewicz, US Army, Police Reformation Directorate, CSTC-A of the law enforcement agency in Afghanistan. It is a branch of the Afghan National Police and has stations in major cities and towns across Afghanistan.\n\n\n== Role ==\nANCOP\'s mission is to provide civil order presence patrols, prevent violent public incidents, and provide crisis and anti-terror response in urban and metropolitan environments. Like the Afghan Border Police, ANCOP is a branch of the Afghan National Police (ANP), under the nation\'s Ministry of Interior Affairs. However, both units, ANCOP and Border Police are planned to be transferred to the Defense Ministry.\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\nANCOP\'s 5,365 authorized strength is commanded by a Major General. ANCOP is divided into five Brigades, each commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, Paktia, Kandahar, Herat, and Mazar-i-Sharif.\nGiven they undergo 16 weeks of training and have a higher literacy rate than the regular Afghan National Police, ANCOP are generally considered a more elite force than the regular ANP that oversees them. They are the most deployable force of the ANP. Since December 2009, the French gendarmes (43 in March 2011) and the Spanish officers, Dutch and Polish, under the mandate of the European Gendarmerie Force, operating in the training center of the Afghan National Civil Order Police to Mazar-e-Sharif. The training center in Western Afghanistan\'s Herat Province is staffed with a contingent of Italian Carbinieri augmented by a number of Polish Military Police and United States Marines.\nThe ANCOP are routinely utilized as a replacement force when a local unit of ANP are sent for initial training to a NATO-led basic training facility. As well, ANCOP are also heavily utilized as a "surge" force of police wherever necessary within the country. As a result, an average ANCOP officer has been deployed on the front lines for a longer average time than his regular ANP counterpart; which has created an inordinate amount of turnover within the ANCOP force.\n\n\n== Salary and benefits ==\nIn return for the higher commitment of training and fighting, ANCOP officers are promoted to sergeant and receive approximately $265 a month, roughly double the salary of a regular new ANP recruit. The ANCOP personnel have thwarted several insurgent attacks over the last few years in Kabul.\n\n\n== Special Support Battalion ==\nIt has two SWAT teams, several explosive ordnance disposal teams, a heavy weapons company, transportation company and logistics support company.\n\n\n== References ==', 'Eudonia atmogramma is a moth in the Crambidae family. It was described by Meyrick in 1915. It is found in New Zealand.\nThe wingspan is 23–24 mm. The forewings are ochreous-grey, usually suffused with whitish on the veins. The interneural spaces are suffusedly sprinkled with dark fuscous. The hindwings are light grey, but paler towards the base. Adults have been recorded on wing in September.\n\n\n== References ==', 'This is a list of designated terrorist groups by national governments, former governments, and inter-governmental organizations, where the proscription has a significant effect on the group\'s activities. Many organizations that are accused of being a terrorist organization deny using terrorism as a military tactic to achieve their goals, and there is no international consensus on the legal definition of terrorism. Some organisations have multiple wings or components, one or more of which may be designated as terrorist while others are not.\nThis listing does not include unaffiliated individuals accused of terrorism, which are considered under lone wolf terrorism. This list also excludes groups that might be widely considered terrorist, but who are not officially so designated according to the criteria specified above.\nThis list is not all inclusive. For more inclusive lists, including people, entities (corporations), and specific vehicles, refer to lists under Process of designation.\n\n\n== Organizations currently officially designated as terrorist by various governments ==\nThe list includes references to organisations associated with Al-Qaeda by the United Nations.\n = officially designated as terrorist\n\n\n== Organizations officially designated as terrorist in the past ==\nBelow is the list of organizations that have officially been designated as terrorist in the past, by the respective parties, but have since been delisted.\n\n\n== Process of designation ==\nAmong the countries that publish a list of designated terrorist organizations, some have a clear established procedure for listing and delisting, and some are opaque. The Berghof Foundation argues that opaque delisting conditions reduce the incentive for the organization to abandon terrorism, while fuelling radicalism.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\n\nSince 2002, the Australian Government maintains a list of terrorist organizations under the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002. Listing, de-listing and re-listing follows a protocol that mainly involves the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General\'s Department.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nSince December 18, 2001, section 83.05 of the Canadian Criminal Code allows the Governor in Council to maintain a list of entities that are engaged in terrorism, facilitating it, or acting on behalf of such an entity.\nEntities are reviewed by the Minister and the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, and finally published in the Canada Gazette. The list is also published on the website of Public Safety Canada.\n\n\n=== European Union ===\nThe European Union has two lists of designated terrorist organisations that provide for different sanctions for the two groups. The first list is copied from the United Nations, and the second is an autonomous list.\n\n\n==== Autonomous list ====\nAll other designated organizations.\nthe freezing of all funds, other financial assets and economic resources.\na ban on directly or indirectly making funds, other financial assets and economic resources available.\nIt is important to note that sanctions are only applicable to EU-external groups regardless of designation. For example, 47 groups are listed as terrorist organizations in the EU but sanctions are only applied to 27 of these. Member States do have an obligation to assist each other in preventing and combating terrorist acts but this is the only action that follows from the designation of an EU-internal organization.\nEuropean Union list of terrorist groups and individuals, 25 June 2012.\n\n\n==== Listing process ====\nNew organizations are added to the autonomous list following this process:\n"Designation": Member states and third party states tips about an organization. This state must have solid evidence and must the tip must be sent by the national authority.\nScrutinity: The Presidency, or a delegation, gathers basic information, and might require more information from the tipping state.\nConsultations: Information is shared with other member states for discussion. Everything is still confidential. 15 days after, delegates of the states meet as the CP 931 Working Party, Europol is sometimes invited too.\nRecommendation: The CP 931 Working Party prepares the listing decision.\nDecision by EU Council: The council adopts the list. The decision must be unanimous, which means that every state has a veto right.\nOfficial Publishing: In the EU Official Journal\nNotification and Statement of Reason: The council secretariat notifies each designated organization via mail, together with instructions on how to get the decision to be reconsidered.\n\n\n==== Delisting process ====\nThe EU has similar process to review the list, and to remove organizations for the list.\n\n\n=== India ===\nUnder the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the Ministry of Home Affairs maintains a list of banned organizations: List of organisations banned by the Government of India.\n\n\n=== Korea ===\n\nThe Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea outlawed the Aum Shinrikyo as an terrorist group.\nThe Republic of Korea, however, has not yet listed a number of designated terrorist groups. Such groups banned under the National Security Act for example, the Workers\' Party of Korea, the ruling party of North Korea and al-Qaeda.\n\n\n=== Myanmar (Burma) ===\nThe Central Committee for Counter-Terrorism of Myanmar is responsible for determining and designating organisations as terrorist groups. The only group on Myanmar\'s terror list is the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, declared on 26 August 2017 in accordance with the country\'s counter-terrorism law.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nThe New Zealand Police are responsible for coordinating any requests to the Prime Minister for designation as a terrorist entity.\n\n\n=== People\'s Republic of China ===\nThe Ministry of Public Security maintains a list of terrorist organizations on its website mps.gov.cn. This list has been translated to English by the Embassy of the People\'s Republic of China in the USA.\n\n\n=== Philippines ===\nThe first group to be officially listed as a terrorist organization under the Human Security Act of 2007 is the Abu Sayyaf on September 10, 2015 by the Basilan provincial court.\nOn December 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte reportedly issued a proclamation declaring the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People\'s Army (NPA), as terrorist organizations. The proclamation was made in accordance with the Human Security Act and the Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act.\nHistorically the CPP-NPA has been considered as an "organized conspiracy" by the Philippines Government. The label was placed on the CPP\'s predecessor, the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 and its armed group the Hukbalahap in 20 June 1957 through the Anti Subversion Act or Republic Act No. 1700. The law covered any succeeding organizations of the PKP-1930 and the Hukbalahap which includes the CPP-NPA. Being a member of groups covered by the law is considered illegal. On October 1992, Fidel Ramos signed a law repealing the Anti-Subversion law.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\nA single federal list of organizations recognized as terrorist is used by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. The National Anti-Terrorism Committee maintains a list of terrorist organizations on its website nac.gov.ru, which named as Federal United list of Terrorist Organizations.\n\n\n=== Serbia ===\nSerbian authorities and their Yugoslav predecessors regard the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) as a terrorist group.\n\n\n=== Tajikistan ===\nIn 2015, the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan was banned in Tajikistan as a terrorist organization.\n\n\n=== Ukraine ===\nIn Ukraine, the Donetsk and Luhansk People\'s Republics are designated as terrorist organizations. Ukrainian authorities claim that the two organizations are made up of a rigid hierarchy, financing channels and supply of weapons with the purpose of deliberately propagating violence, seizing hostages, carrying out subversive activity, assassinations, and the intimidation of citizens.\n\n\n=== United Nations ===\nThe United Nations does not have a general list of all terrorist organizations. Instead, it has several lists focusing on a particular context.\n\n\n==== UN 1267 regime list ====\nThe UN 1267 regime list is focused on Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and their associates.\nprohibition of sale or transfer of arms and related materiel.\nthe freezing of funds and other financial assets or resources.\nthe prevention of entry onto or transit through the territories of member states.\na prohibition on provision of technical assistance or training in military matters or in the manufacture or maintenance of arms and related materiel.\nThe EU provides exceptions to the implementation of relevant asset-freezing sanctions per UN resolution 1452 (2002).

He became a professor at the State Conservatory in Lviv and Vienna, and Prague Conservatory.\nHis students included his daughter Ilona Štěpánová-Kurzová, Rudolf Firkušný, Eduard Steuermann, Artur Rodziński, Břetislav Bakala, Pavel Štěpán, Stanislav Heller, František Maxián, Gidéon Klein, Rafael Schächter, Viktorie Švihlíková, Ilja Hurník, Drahomir Toman, Zdeněk Jílek and Matusja Blum. See: List of music students by teacher: K to M#Vilém Kurz.\nHis teaching methods were largely based on those of Theodor Leschetizky and his pupils he met during the time he taught in Lviv. Later they were further developed by his daughter Ilona Štěpánová-Kurzová.\nHe died in Prague in 1945.\n\n\n== Antonin Dvořák\'s Piano Concerto in G minor ==\nKurz is known for his reworking of the solo part of Antonín Dvořák\'s Piano Concerto in G minor, Op. 33, which was originally composed in 1876. For more than a decade after the concerto\'s first performance, it suffered from neglect and critical disdain. A common remark for many years was that the piano part was written "as if for two right hands."\nWhile he was in his 20s, Kurz undertook a revision of the solo part, and it is this version that he frequently performed. Since that time, the original and the Kurz versions have been printed together in Otakar Šourek\'s critical edition of the score, one beneath the other, so that the soloist can choose which version to perform. The Kurz version has become a part of the standard piano repertoire. Dvořák\'s original orchestral material is not affected by the soloist\'s choice. In 1919 Ilona Kurzová played the first performance of the Kurz version of the concerto, conducted by Václav Talich. This revision was later adopted and recorded by Rudolf Firkušný, who in the 1950s also introduced a few cuts to the first and third movements. In the 1970s he abandoned all revisions in favour of the original version by Dvořák.\nSupraphon, the Czech recording company, issued a compact disc on which Ivan Moravec plays the Kurz version, with the Czech Philharmonic conducted by Jiří Bělohlávek, while Radoslav Kvapil plays the composer\'s original score, with the Brno Philharmonic Orchestra under František Jílek.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRafael Schächter\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDr. Zdeňka Böhmová-Zahradníčková: Vilém Kurz, SNKL n.p.

Its nickname "miller moth" comes from the fine scales on its wings that rub off easily and remind people of the dusty flour that covers the clothing of a miller.\n\nIts caterpillars are pests of oat (Avena sativa) and common wheat (Triticum aestivum). The miller moth is a seasonal nuisance in the spring in states including Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and Kansas, as they hatch in the low-lying farmlands, then migrate to higher elevations for the summer. They return as the weather cools but in smaller numbers. They are considered nearly impossible to control through normal pest extermination techniques because a new batch shows up every day as they migrate. With their very small bodies, they enter homes (attracted by the light) in the evening through any available crack or crevice (doorjamb, chimney, etc.) and residents in migration paths report dozens of moths per day entering their homes and garages. However, other than being a nuisance, they are not considered harmful.\n\n\n== Location ==\nEuxoa auxiliaris is commonly found in the Western section and prairies of the United States. They are known to travel to alpine climate regions in late June and early July where they feed at night on the nectar of wildflowers. Army cutworms are one of the richest foods for predators, such as brown bears, in this ecosystem, where up to 72 per cent of the moth\'s body weight is fat, thus making it more calorie-rich than elk or deer. This is the highest known body fat percentage of any animal.\n\n\n== References ==', 'Octave is a UK unit for whisky.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nApproximately 16 gallons.\n\n\n== Conversion ==\n1 Octave = 16 gallons \n1 Octave = \n1 Octave = 0.073 m3\n\n\n== References ==', 'Henry Day is a British Army Colonel who made the first British ascent (second ever ascent) of Annapurna I.\n\n\n== References ==', "Richard Eromoigbe (born 26 June 1984 in Lagos) is a Nigerian football midfielder.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn January 2002 Eromoigbe signed a contract with Bulgarian club Levski Sofia and joined Cherno More Varna in a year-long loan move, alongside his compatriot Emanuel Baba.

Khunjerab National Park is Pakistan\'s third largest national park, and is adjacent to the Taxkorgan Natural Reserve in China.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nKhun means "blood" and jerav means "to stream" in Wakhi, the native language of the region.\n\n\n== History ==\nKhunjerab National Park was established primarily as a means to protect the Marco Polo sheep (as well as snow leopards and bharal) living in the area. The borders of the park were mapped by Schaller in 1974, after a short field survey. The park was formally established on 29 April 1979 by Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who said that "it must become a world famous park".\n\nDespite being listed as a category 2 national park, banning human activities including agriculture and hunting, the park was poorly managed, meaning that illegal hunting of the Marco Polo sheep continued. Because of this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature commissioned Norwegian biologist Per Wegge to do a wildlife survey of the park in 1988. Wegge found that there was no evidence of competition between the domestic sheep being illegally grazed and the wild Marco Polo sheep, and that most of the illegal hunting was not being done by local Wakhi residents. He therefore proposed that the park be reclassified, allowing grazing and commercial hunting, with the profits going to local residents. However, the government overlooked Wegge\'s suggestions, instead drawing up a new management plan, which both the IUCN and the World Wildlife Fund supported as a means to preserve the park and protect the wildlife. Wegge was critical of the government scheme, claiming that it was based on financial considerations, with the Pakistani government hoping to attract tourists to the area. The IUCN agreed with this, and has since distanced itself from the national park. To help protect the animals from poaching, the WWF has created the Khunzerav Village Organization, which relies on people living in the area to report poaching or endangered animal sightings. This park was created on 29 April 1975 on the recommendation of wildlife biologist Dr. George Schaller. Over half of the park is above 4,000 m. Khunjerab Pass, the gateway to China via the Karakoram Highway, is at 4,934 m.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\nThe primary purpose of this park was to provide protection to the endangered Marco Polo sheep, which is only found in this area in Pakistan. According to the Mir of Hunza, the population of sheep was around 400 but had dropped to below 180 by the time of the completion of the Karakoram Highway. A herd of almost 75 Marco Polo sheep was recorded in the spring of 1984 and park staff saw at least 50 crossing the pass in May 1989.\nThe park is also famous for its snow leopards. Some reports say that it might contain the highest density of these beautiful cats in the total Himalayan ecosystem, which is the natural habitat of these cats. Over 2,000 Siberian ibex, widely distributed and abundant in the park but absent from neighbouring China, are also present here.\n\n\n== Mammals ==\nTotal species: 16.

It is their first and only album to be released through Wind-up Records, and is also the first release since If Only You Were Lonely to employ screamed vocals, with guitarist Micah Carli adding limited vocals into select tracks on the record. The album was produced by Howard Benson. The album peaked at #50 on the Billboard top 200 albums.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn February 2, 2009, it was announced that the band had signed to independent label Wind-up Records and would release their next album with the label later in the year. Drummer Eron Bucciarelli said Wind-up Records was "still an indie [label] but with the power of a major [label]. ... Its a tight knit group who still truly put the music first and that\'s comforting to us." Vocalist/guitarist JT Woodruff said the band was "extremely happy" to be signed to Wind-up Records. In addition, he said it was important to the group that they signed with "a label that has maintained a consistent staff and who understands who we want to be as Hawthorne Heights." Bucciarelli mentioned that the band had been working on their next album since May 2008. Four days later, the band made a blog post about their forthcoming album. They said they were "going to hit the studio and release the album as soon as possible without compromising the quality of the songs."\n\n\n== Production ==\nOn May 1, 2009, the band announced they were going to Hollywood, California for the course of two months to record their next album. In addition, they revealed that while there is not a new member and no replacement was made for former guitarist/vocalist, Casey Calvert, the new album would feature a new "screamer". While on tour, Hawthorne Heights announced that Micah Carli would now be providing vocals for the band.\nAs the album was being recorded, Woodruff and Bucciarelli named two songs from the record on several occasions, leading many to believe that they would be released as singles. Acoustic versions of the two songs were also said to have been recorded. The songs are entitled "Here I Am" and "Nervous Breakdown". On October 2, 2009, both Woodruff and Buicarelli posted updates on their Twitter pages saying that they had just finished gang vocals for the record. Woodruff stated "Just finished up doing gang vocals on a few songs. Return to hardcore!"\nThe band has expressed that the process of writing the music and lyrics to this album has been different from doing so for albums past. Woodruff states: "We had the luxury of time to sit around and think about what we wanted to do, which helped us create something new." Bucciarelli adds: "We wrote more songs for this album than ever before. We wrote over 30, then whittled them down to the absolute best ones. We took parts from some and added them to others and made a Frankenstein out of [th]em. We were always writing, re-writing, arranging and re-arranging. Howard Benson really pushed us in the song writing department to go against what we’ve done in the past."\n\n\n== Release ==\nOn November 16, 2009, download cards for the song "Unforgivable" were distributed while on tour. The final track listing for the album was publicly announced on February 5, 2010. On March 23, "Nervous Breakdown" was released as the first official single from the album. The song impacted radio on April 27. On April 21, "End of the Underground" was made available for listening on Buzznet. On May 18, "Drive" was released as a digital single through Rhapsody. The track was made available for download from Verizon as a ringtone on May 20. On May 25, all songs from Skeletons (excluding bonus tracks) were added to Hawthorne Heights\' Myspace music player for listening. On May 28, "Nervous Breakdown (Acoustic)" was made available as a free download separate from Skeletons. Skeletons was released on June 1 through Wind-up Records. On September 28, "Bring You Back" was declared a single by Hawthorne Heights on their official website, and began receiving regular radio airplay.\n\n\n== Reviews and reception ==\nSkeletons has received generally positive reviews. A review on the AbsolutePunk website has stated that the album brings out "JT Woodruff’s best vocal performance yet," and is full of "killer choruses."\nIn an early review of the album, RoomThirteen.com gave the album a 12 out of 13 rating. They stated "For those who fell in love with Hawthorne Heights six years ago, ‘Skeletons’ will merely reaffirm their passion for a band that has survived so much in such a short time. For those who have yet to truly listen to the band, this is an album that will alter your perceptions."\nSkeletons stylistically reverts to "music similar to their first two albums", although it has substantially less non-singing vocals. The album "refuses to stomp over old ground" by incorporating "electro" and "pop punk" elements into a few of the tracks. Other reviewers, though, criticize the album by calling it "safe", and saying that it doesn\'t take any "deviations from the beaten path."\n\n\n== 2009 Never Sleep Again tour ==\n\nOn October 14, an e-mail about a nationwide 2009 tour was sent out to the Hawthorne Heights official mailing list. The e-mail stated:\nNot all of the bands mentioned ended up joining Hawthorne Heights for the 2009 Never Sleep Again tour. Anarbor declined the offer in order to focus on the recording of their debut album The Words You Don\'t Swallow. Likewise, Punchline declined and was replaced with The Story Changes, a rock band that formed in Dayton, Ohio, the same city Hawthorne Heights originated in.\nFans had a chance to hear two songs from the upcoming album during this tour, however. As promised, download cards for the song "Unforgivable" were distributed while on tour. In addition, "End of the Underground," which was originally going to be included as a track on the band\'s previous album, was performed live. On Skeletons, "Unforgivable" became track number 12, and "End of the Underground" became track number 3.\n\n\n== Album title ==\nThe album\'s title is not taken from any of the tracks\' titles, or even lyrical content on the album (although "End of the Underground" does make lyrical references to skeletons); instead, Woodruff explained:\nThus, the album was given the name Skeletons.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll lyrics written by JT Woodruff; all music composed by Hawthorne Heights.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nHawthorne Heights\nJT Woodruff - Lead vocals, piano, rhythm guitar\nMicah Carli - Lead guitar, death growls\nMatt Ridenour - Bass, backing vocals\nEron Bucciarelli - Drums, percussion\nProduction\nAlbum produced by Howard Benson\nAlbum art created by Mike Egan\nAlbum mastering by Scott Hull\n\n\n== References ==', 'Johannes Steuchius (January 3, 1676 – June 21, 1742) was Archbishop of Uppsala in the Church of Sweden from 1730 to his death.\nHe was born in Härnösand, the son of the previous archbishop Mathias Steuchius.

He made his fortune manufacturing various items, but especially buttons using the process, he later diversified into making cast steel and saws.\n\n\n== Early years and apprenticeship ==\n\nBoulsover was born in Longley, which was then a remote hamlet between the town of Sheffield and the village of Ecclesfield, He was the son of Samuel Boulsover, a farmer and cutler and Margaret Brownell of Hathersage, being baptised at Ecclesfield church on 18 October 1705. He began his apprenticeship to learn the trade of cutler in 1718, being apprenticed to Joseph Fletcher, a native of Wirksworth in Derbyshire who had established himself as a cutler in Sheffield. Fletcher was a Presbyterian and the young Boulsover would have been brought up with the same religious views as it was expected that an apprentice would join his master and family in their manner of worship. Thomas Boulsover’s apprenticeship was completed in 1726 and he was granted the freedom of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire on 26 November of that year, the act being recorded in the Freedoms Book at the Cutlers' Hall. As was traditional Boulsover was also awarded his own trademark and this was registered in the Mark Book.\n\n\n== Cutler ==\nBoulsover chose to practice as a free cutler in the developing township of Sheffield and on 28 October 1728 he married Hannah Dodworth of Owlerton at Sheffield parish church, they set up home in the Norfolk Street area where groups of cutlers were settling in newly built properties. The Boulsovers' first child Sarah was born in June 1729 but the infant soon died; the Boulsovers had ten children throughout their marriage of which only two survived to adulthood. Thomas Boulsover continued as a cutler, with several apprentices working for him over the years; in the early 1740s he moved his business to new premises on Sycamore Hill (now Tudor Street) the workshop being on the corner of Tudor Street and Surrey Street opposite the present day Sheffield Central Library.\n\n\n== Sheffield plate ==\n\nIn early 1743 Boulsover made the accidental discovery which was to change his life and have an immense effect on the success and development of Sheffield. While repairing the decorative handle of a knife made from copper and silver he accidentally slightly overheated the handle causing the two metals to fuse. Boulsover’s initial despair at ruining a customer’s expensive knife soon turned to elation when he realised the significance and potential of his find. Boulsover experimented with his discovery of Sheffield Plate and found that when the silver and copper were fused together they could be treated as one metal, meaning that an ingot of copper fused with a layer of silver could be rolled to any area and thickness and still retain the same proportion of the two metals. This satisfied Boulsover that the fused metal could be modelled into any article and could be used on a commercial scale.\nThomas Boulsover needed financial assistance to set up a business in fused plate and it came from Mr Strelley Pegge of Beauchief Hall who loaned him the necessary capital. He went into partnership with Joseph Wilson whose father was a scythe smith at Sharrow, setting up a workshop on Baker's Hill in Sheffield. The main product of the business was to make buttons from fused plate which would cost only a fraction of the cost of solid silver buttons. Boulsover's buttons were stamped from a die on a fused metal sheet, then cut out, polished and burnished until they were hardly distinguishable from genuine silver. The business also made buckles, spurs and small snuff boxes. Joseph Wilson left the partnership in the mid 1740s, setting up his own business at Sharrow Mills making Sheffield plate items before diversifying into manufacturing snuff for which the Wilsons became World famous. In 1749 Boulsover rented a lease of land in Beeley Wood to build a grinding wheel, but an alteration to the original lease allowed it to be converted into a tilt forge known as the Nova Scotia Tilts.\nThomas Boulsover repaid the money loaned from Strelley Pegge and continued his enterprise with the help of two apprentices, also hiring John Hoyland as an agent to promote the sale of his buttons. Unfortunately Boulsover did not take out a patent on his discovery of Sheffield plate and Hoyland set up a business of his own making buttons and passed the secrets of the process on to others. Despite this competition, Boulsover’s button business thrived. In 1751 Thomas was elected as one of the 24 assistants to the Master Cutler, however even though he was re-elected as an assistant the following year he never rose any higher in the Company of Cutlers. In 1757 he moved his business to larger premises on Norfolk Street (now the location of the Crucible Theatre stage door), in the same year he bought Whiteley Wood Hall from his initial patron Strelley Pegge. Now a member of the gentry, Boulsover’s guidance as a leading townsman was eagerly sought; he became involved in discussions on the Sheffield to Leeds turnpike road and became one of the original trustees.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1760 Boulsover turned his interest to manufacturing better quality steel. He purchased land from the Duke of Norfolk on the Porter Brook just below Whiteley Wood Hall and commenced rolling steel. He discovered that cast steel gave a much better edge to saws and concentrated on saw making, with his product being far superior to those made by the old method of hammering. In 1774 Boulsover & Co., based at Whiteley Woods and Norfolk Street, was described as “makers of saws, fenders, edge tools, cast steel and emory”. However button production continued at a site further up the Porter at Forge Dam, Fulwood.\n\nIn 1772 Hannah Boulsover, Thomas’s wife died and was buried in the churchyard of St Paul’s Church on 9 July. The couple had been married for almost 44 years. As Thomas Boulsover grew older, he was helped by Anthony Thompson whom he had taken into partnership and who eventually took over the management of the rolling mills and saw manufacture. Thomas Boulsover died at Whiteley Wood Hall on Tuesday 9 September 1788 and was buried on 13 September at St Paul’s church alongside Hannah. Early in 1789, Boulsover’s two surviving children Mary Mitchell and Sarah Hutton built a small Methodist chapel near to Whiteley Wood Hall in memory of their father. The chapel still stands today although it is now an outbuilding of Meadow Farm. It has an plaque which reads “This chapel was built by Mary Mitchell and Sarah Hutton in 1789 in memory of their father Thomas Boulsover the inventor of Sheffield Plate (1705 - 1788).\n\n\n== References ==", 'Catherine Bateson (born 1960 in Brisbane) is an Australian writer.\nCatherine Bateson grew up in a second-hand bookshop in Brisbane.

Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area. A dispersed settlement contrasts with a nucleated village.\nThe French term bocage is sometimes used to describe the type of landscape found where dispersed settlements are common.\nIn addition to Western Europe, dispersed patterns of settlement are found in parts of Papua New Guinea, as among the Gainj, Ankave, and Baining tribes. It is also frequently met with in normadic pastoral societies.\n\n\n== England ==\nIn England, dispersed settlements are often found in the areas of ancient enclosure outside the central region—for example, Essex, Kent and the West Country. An example of a dispersed settlement given by W G Hoskins is Middle Barton in Steeple Barton, Oxfordshire.\nIn some parts of England, the pattern of dispersed settlement has remained unchanged for many hundreds of years. Many of the locations found in Domesday may be dispersed farmsteads. It is sometimes possible to identify documentary references to farmsteads in the 18th or 19th centuries with these Domesday entries.\nIn areas of Kent and Essex close to London, development of residential housing during the 20th century has often disguised the dispersed nature of the original settlement.\nThe farmsteads which make up the dispersed settlement are often surrounded by small irregularly shaped fields. Traditionally, trees are encouraged to grow at the edges of these fields and in thin strips alongside roads. However, during the 20th century, much of this woodland disappeared, either as a result of disease or modern farming practice.

The population was 216 at the 2010 census.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Burlington and Missouri River Railroad Company established a station at Lucas in 1866, named after Lucas County and Robert Lucas. A plat for the town was filed on May 9, 1868 and the town was incorporated on March 18, 1887. The town grew slowly until coal was discovered in the area.\n\nIn 1876, the Whitebreast Coal and Mining Company began working a 250-foot (76 m) shaft one mile (1.6 km) east of Lucas. This proved successful, and in 1878, they platted a company town there, which they named Cleveland 41°1′57.21″N 93°26′38.71″W. By 1880, Cleveland had a population of 380, and the first mine was producing 650 to 700 tons of coal per day by the labor of 280 miners and 33 mule drivers. A second mine was opened 3/4 mile from the first, and the two mines sold coal to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, and several other railroads to the south and west. The Cleveland post office was open from 1877 to 1891 and then reopened between 1899 and 1908. Very little remained of Cleveland by the 1930s.\nIn 1893, the Lucas Coal Company was working a two-foot coal seam 83 feet (25 m) down, employing 24 men.\nThe Big Hill mine in Lucas worked a 4-foot-thick (1.2 m) coal seam 274 feet (84 m) below the surface using room and pillar methods, with a shaft not far from the Burlington station. This mine was closed in April 1904 and stripped of equipment, but by mid-1905, plans were in place to reopen it. The reopening lasted until 1907, when the mine was again closed, as the rock directly above the coal was sandstone and it was saturated with water. This mine is noteworthy because John L Lewis got his first coal mining job here, before going on to head the United Mine Workers of America.\nUnited Mine Workers local 799 was organized in Lucas in 1899; its membership was 121 in 1902, but it fell to 57 in 1907 and just 24 in 1912. UMW local 1120 was organized in Cleveland in 1899; membership was 350 in 1902, fell to 125 in 1907 and no membership was reported in 1912. Mine wages varied from $2.36 to $2.56 per day in Cleveland in 1907 (there are no wage figures for Lucas that year).\nIn 1919, Lucas was home to the second most productive coal mine in Iowa, Mine No. 2 of the Central Iowa Fuel Company. This produced 217,169 tons of coal that year and employed 360 men. The last coal mine in the Lucas area was the Iowa-Nebraska Mine, closed in 1923. This mine was located about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) southwest of Lucas (41°0′50.65″N 93°28′50.03″W). The former mine site is now in the Lucas Unit of the Stephens State Forest. The site is now the site of Mine Pond and the Mine Pond Campground in the state forest. This forest was a base of operations for the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The CCC established the pine and hardwood forest that now dominates this land.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLucas\'s longitude and latitude coordinates in decimal form are 41.029843, −93.461595.\nLucas is located on the north bank of White Breast Creek, a tributary of the Des Moines River that flows east through the Southern Iowa drift plain.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.98 square miles (2.54 km2), of which, 0.97 square miles (2.51 km2) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) is water.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 216 people, 89 households, and 59 families residing in the city.

They are notable for their singles "Seein\' Red" and "Save Me (Wake Up Call)," both of which entered the top 5 in the US Modern Rock charts. Their sixth studio album, Swan, was released March 29, 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early years (1990–1996) ===\nUnwritten Law formed in Poway, California in 1990. Original drummer Wade Youman generally takes credit for starting the band. The band was founded by Youman, vocalist Chris Mussey, guitarist Matt Rathje, and bassist Craig Winters. A number of players came and went before the lineup coalesced to include Scott Russo on vocals, Steve Morris and Rob Brewer on guitar, and John Bell on bass. They released their first cassette demo in 1992, followed by the 7" vinyl single Blurr in 1993. The band quickly established themselves in the prolific San Diego music scene of the early 1990s that also included groups such as Blink-182, Buck-O-Nine, Sprung Monkey, One by One, Drive Like Jehu, and Rocket from the Crypt.\nIn 1994 the band recorded their first album, Blue Room, which was released by local label Red Eye Records. It established their early sound of fast-paced punk rock and gave them the opportunity to build their reputation by playing local shows in and around the San Diego area. Songs such as "CPK," "Shallow," and "Suzanne" would become favorites with local fans and would remain in their live set for years to come.\n\n\n=== Major label signing (1996–1999) ===\nBlue Room attracted the attention of Epic Records, who signed the band to a recording contract. Their second album, Oz Factor, was released in 1996. The songs "Denied" and "Superman" received airplay on several southern California rock radio stations and were released as singles. Over the next year the band toured the United States with bands such as Blink-182 and Pennywise.\nBy 1997 Unwritten Law had signed to Interscope Records and bassist John Bell had left the band. Pivit bassist Micah Albao joined them in Seattle for the recording of their self-titled album Unwritten Law which was released in 1998. The singles "Lonesome," "Cailin," and "Teenage Suicide" became minor hits on rock radio stations. Pat "PK" Kim, formerly of Sprung Monkey, joined as their new permanent bass player and the band embarked on the Vans Warped Tour, which took them across North America, Europe, and Australia. In Australia the band developed an enthusiastic and dedicated following, and they would return there over the next few years and release several singles and live recordings exclusive to the country.\n\n\n=== Elva, Here\'s to the Mourning, and mainstream popularity (2000–2005) ===\nThe band spent a considerable amount of time recording and preparing their next release, 2002\'s Elva. The album was a stylistic change of pace, deliberately moving away from their established punk rock formula and towards a more accessible hard rock sound. The lead single "Up All Night" became somewhat popular, but it was "Seein\' Red" and its accompanying music video which brought the band their greatest success, reaching No. 1 on US modern rock charts. They toured extensively in support of the album alongside bands such as Sum 41 and The Used.\nIn 2003 the band was invited by VH1 to film an episode of the live acoustic series Music in High Places. The invitation happened somewhat by accident, as the station was hoping to attract Jimmy Eat World but contacted Unwritten Law\'s management by mistake. The band recorded a set of acoustic performances in various locales at Yellowstone National Park. They prepared the recordings for release as an album, but Interscope declined to release it. The band ended their contract with Interscope and signed to Lava Records, who released Music in High Places as an album. The performance was also released as a DVD entitled Live in Yellowstone. The song "Rest of My Life" from this performance received airplay on modern rock radio stations nationwide. The band\'s song Celebration Song was featured in the soundtracks of Need For Speed: Underground 2 and MX vs ATV Unleashed.\nShortly after the release of Music in High Places founding drummer Wade Youman was ejected from the band due to personal and professional issues. Wade later went on to Join The Rattlesnake Aces. For the recording of their next album Here\'s to the Mourning drummers Adrian Young of No Doubt and Tony Palermo of Pulley joined the band in the studio. The band got along so well with Palermo that by the time of the album\'s release in 2005 he had joined as their permanent drummer. Much of the lyrics on the album were co-written by singer Scott Russo\'s girlfriend Aimee Allen, with whom he formed the side project Scott & Aimee. Allen and Linda Perry contributed to the writing of the album\'s lead single "Save Me (Wake Up Call)," which reached No. 5 on US modern rock charts. This was followed by the single "She Says."\nIn March 2005 guitarist Rob Brewer was fired from Unwritten Law after a physical altercation on stage with Russo. Russo and other band members collectively decided to remove Brewer from the band. The band chose not to replace him and continued on as a 4-piece. They continued to tour in support of Here\'s to the Mourning across the United States as well as internationally.\n\n\n=== Best of Compilation, Live and Lawless and Swan (2006–2011) ===\nUnwritten Law spent much of 2006 recording a "best of" album entitled The Hit List, which was released on January 2, 2007 by Abydos Records. It includes 17 of the band\'s most popular songs, most of which were re-recorded by the current lineup, as well as 2 new songs including lead single "Shoulda Known Better." Interscope also released a "best of" compilation entitled 20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection which includes songs from the albums Unwritten Law and Elva. On January 3, 2007 the band performed "Shoulda Known Better" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. That July the band embarked on a North American tour in support of The Hit List, with Scott & Aimee drummer Dylan Howard filling in for roughly half the tour while Palermo stayed home with his wife, who was due to give birth.\nAlso during 2007, Palermo acted as fill-in touring drummer for Papa Roach. In March 2008 it was announced that Palermo had joined Papa Roach permanently. Meanwhile, Unwritten Law, with new drummer Dylan Howard, filmed a live DVD at the Key Club in Hollywood, California in March 2008. The album, titled Live and Lawless, was released September 30, 2008 through Suburban Noize Records. Unwritten Law\'s sixth studio album, Swan, was also released through Suburban Noize on March 29, 2011. On January 24, 2011, Unwritten Law posted on their Myspace page the first single from their new album called "Starships and Apocalypse." They have also been confirmed to play the 2011 Warped Tour.\nGuitarist Steve Morris and bassist Pat Kim left Unwritten Law at the end of their Swan Tour in 2011 due to a physical altercation between Scott Russo and Morris. This was kept silent for a few months until after the band finished touring with Warped Tour, although Morris and Kim did not tour with them. Derik Envy, formerly of Red Light Sky, and Kevin Besignano, formerly of Bullets and Octane, had become the permanent replacements for Kim and Morris, respectively.\n\n\n=== Lineup changes and Acoustic (2013–present) ===\nIn 2013, founding drummer, Wade Youman, returned to Unwritten Law, after a reconciliation with Scott Russo. Following Youman\'s return, Derik Envy and Kevin Besignano both left the band, being replaced with Johnny Grill (Russo\'s younger brother) and Chris Lewis (Fenix TX), respectively. The band is currently working on an acoustic album, which will be followed soon after with a new studio album.\nWhile performing at Capitol in Perth, Western Australia on 18 May 2014, the band ignored requests to stop playing after the venue\'s midnight curfew had passed, forcing the venue to cut the power on stage. Frontman Scott Russo and drummer Wade Youman subsequently destroyed a hired DW Collector\'s Series drum kit.\nUnwritten Law released a new compilation album called Acoustic on Cyber Track Records on April 1, 2016\n\n\n== Band members ==\nCurrent members\nScott Russo – lead vocals, (1990–present) guitar (2005–present) )\nWade Youman – drums (1990–2004, 2013–present)\nChris Lewis – guitar, backing vocals (2014–present)\nJonny Grill – bass, backing vocals (2013–present)\nFormer members\nJeff Brehm – bass guitar (1990–1995)\nRob Brewer – guitar (1990–2005)\nSteve Morris – guitar, backing vocals (1990–2011)\nPat "PK" Kim – bass guitar, backing vocals (1998–2011)\nTony Palermo – drums (2005–2008)\nDylan Howard – drums (2008–2013)\nKevin Besignano – guitar, backing vocals (2011–2013)\nDerik Envy – bass guitar (2011–2013)\nAce Von Johnson – guitar, backing vocals (2013–2014)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nStudio albums\nBlue Room (1994)\nOz Factor (1996)\nUnwritten Law (1998)\nElva (2002)\nHere\'s to the Mourning (2005)\nSwan (2011)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website', 'Execrabilis is a papal bull issued by Pope Pius II on 18 January 1460 condemning conciliarism. The bull received its name from the opening word of its Latin text, which labelled as "execrable" all efforts to appeal an authoritative ruling of a Pope to a council.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1415, the Council of Constance sought to put a definitive end to the Western Schism by asserting its authority over the rival papal claimants. It issued a document entitled Haec Sancta which\n\n...declares that if anyone, of whatever rank, condition, or dignity, including the pope, shall refuse to obey the commands, statutes, ordinances, or orders of this holy council, or of any other holy council properly assembled, in regard to the ending of the schism and to the reformation of the church, he shall be subject to the proper punishment, and unless he repents, he shall be duly punished.\n\nThis decree established a precedent whereby even the Pope is subject to the decrees of an ecumenical council. Encouraged by this decree, a rump of bishops defiantly continued to meet at Basel even after Pope Eugene IV had transferred the main body of the Council of Basel to Ferrara. Those remaining at Basel believed themselves to constitute the true council and even felt empowered to declare Eugene IV deposed and elect an anti-pope in response to their eventual excommunication. Although Basel had set out to reform the Catholic Church, the mixed and somewhat confused results it produced, coupled with Eugene IV\'s actions, convinced many to look somewhere other than the papacy for real reforms. At times these conciliarist attempts at reform became a political tool wielded by those who sought to undermine the Pope.\nThese developments posed a significant challenge to the authority of the papal office. In an effort to nullify the threat, Pius II issued Execrabilis to proclaim that the judgments of his office are final and cannot be appealed.\n\n\n== Text ==\nThis bull denounces those who "presume to appeal from the pope to a future council, in spite of the fact that the pope is the vicar of Jesus Christ" and "condemn[s] all such appeals and prohibit[s] them as erroneous and detestable." Penalties for violators of any status or rank, including those having imperial, royal or even papal dignity, are grave. Anyone who contravened this papal decree would "ipso facto incur sentence of anathema, from which he cannot be absolved except by the Roman Pontiff and at the point of death." The bull concludes with a formula also used by Pope Pius XII at the conclusion of his Munificentissimus Deus that if anyone would seek to alter this decree, "let him know that he shall incur the indignation of Almighty God and of Saints Peter and Paul, His apostles."\n\n\n== Reaction ==\nPius II had intended Execrabilis to put a definitive end to all future attempts to appeal papal decisions to a council. However, his intention was weakened by the fact that this injunction was not consistently invoked by subsequent Renaissance popes in response to the various manifestations of conciliarist tendencies. It was further weakened by the fact that it was "viewed less in its day as an authoritative pronouncement than a propagandistic proclamation of the view of one particular faction." However, it was cited in 1483 by his successor Sixtus IV during the War of Ferrara as a pretext to excommunicate the Doge of Venice on account of a Venetian appeal to a council. In 1509, Pope Julius II again invoked Execrabilis when the Venetians appealed to a council during the War of the League of Cambrai.\nWhen Execrabilis was issued, many prelates in France and Germany were opposed to this bull on account of their support for conciliarism. In the 16th century, these conciliarist tendencies helped to generate support for Martin Luther, who had in 1518 lodged with a notary his own appeal to a general council from the judgment of the Pope. In 1520, Pope Leo X alluded to Execrabilis when he brought up the name of his predecessor Pius II in his own bull, Exsurge Domine, which threatened Luther with excommunication for teachings the Catholic Church perceived to be problematic. Leo declared that "...[Luther] broke forth in a rash appeal to a future council. This to be sure was contrary to the constitution of Pius II and Julius II our predecessors that all appealing in this way are to be punished with the penalties of heretics."\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBainton, Roland H.

Software developers can use it to write high-performance computer games and other multimedia applications that can run on many operating systems such as Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.\nSDL manages video, audio, input devices, CD-ROM, threads, shared object loading, networking and timers. For 3D graphics it can handle an OpenGL or Direct3D context.\nThe library is internally written in C and, depending on the target platform, C++ or Objective-C, and provides the application programming interface in C, with bindings to other languages available. It is free and open-source software subject to the requirements of the zlib License since version 2.0 and with prior versions subject to the GNU Lesser General Public License. Under the zlib License, SDL 2.0 is freely available for static linking in closed-source projects, unlike SDL 1.2.\nSDL is extensively used in the industry in both large and small projects. Over 700 games, 180 applications, and 120 demos have also been posted on the library website.\nA common misconception is that SDL is a game engine, but this is not true. However, the library is suited to building games directly or is usable indirectly by engines built on top of it.\n\n\n== History ==\nSam Lantinga created the library, first releasing it in early 1998, while working for Loki Software. He got the idea while porting a Windows application to Macintosh. He then used SDL to port Doom to BeOS (see Doom source ports). Several other free libraries were developed to work alongside SDL, such as SMPEG and OpenAL. He also founded Galaxy Gameworks in 2008 to help commercially support SDL, although the company plans are currently on hold due to time constraints. Soon after putting Galaxy Gameworks on hold, Lantinga announced that SDL 1.3 (which would then later become SDL 2.0) would be licensed under the zlib License. Lantinga announced SDL 2.0 on 14 July 2012, at the same time announcing that he was joining Valve Corporation, the first version of which was announced the same day he joined the company. Lantinga announced the stable release of SDL 2.0.0 on 13 August 2013.\nSDL 2.0 is a major update to the SDL 1.2 codebase with a different, not backwards-compatible API. It replaces several parts of the 1.2 API with more general support for multiple input and output options.\nSome feature additions include multiple window support, hardware-accelerated 2D graphics, and better Unicode support.\nSupport for Mir and Wayland was added in SDL 2.0.2 and enabled by default in SDL 2.0.4.\nBetter support for Android in forthcoming 2.0.4.\n\n\n== Software architecture ==\nSDL is a wrapper around the operating-system-specific functions that the game needs to access. The only purpose of SDL is to provide a common framework for accessing these functions for multiple operating systems (cross-platform). SDL provides support for 2D pixel operations, sound, file access, event handling, timing and threading. It is often used to complement OpenGL by setting up the graphical output and providing mouse and keyboard input, since OpenGL comprises only rendering.\nA game using the Simple DirectMedia Layer will not automatically run on every operating system, further adaptations must be applied. These are reduced to the minimum, since SDL also contains a few abstraction APIs for frequent functions offered by an operating system.\nThe syntax of SDL is function-based: all operations done in SDL are done by passing parameters to subroutines (functions). Special structures are also used to store the specific information SDL needs to handle. There are a few different subsystems SDL categorizes its functions under.\nSDL can be used instead of XInput and XAudio2.\n\n\n=== Subsystems ===\nSDL is divided into several subsystems:\nBasics\nInitialization and Shutdown, Configuration Variables, Error Handling, Log Handling\nVideo\nDisplay and Window Management, surface functions, rendering acceleration, etc.\nInput Events\nEvent handling, Support for Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick and Game controller\nForce Feedback\nSDL_haptic.h implements support for "Force Feedback"\nAudio\nSDL_audio.h implements Audio Device Management, Playing and Recording\nThreads\nmulti-threading: Thread Management, Thread Synchronization Primitives, Atomic Operations\nTimers\nTimer Support\nFile Abstraction\nFilesystem Paths, File I/O Abstraction\nShared Object Support\nShared Object Loading and Function Lookup\nPlatform and CPU Information\nPlatform Detection, CPU Feature Detection, Byte Order and Byte Swapping, Bit Manipulation\nPower Management\nPower Management Status\nAdditional\nPlatform-specific functionality\nBesides this basic, low-level support, there also are a few separate official libraries that provide some more functions. These comprise the "standard library", and are provided on the official website and included in the official documentation:\nSDL_image — support for multiple image formats\nSDL_mixer — complex audio functions, mainly for sound mixing\nSDL_net — networking support\nSDL_ttf — TrueType font rendering support\nSDL_rtf — simple Rich Text Format rendering\nOther, non-standard libraries also exist. For example: SDL_Collide on Sourceforge created by Amir Taaki.\n\n\n=== Language bindings ===\nThe SDL 2.0 library has language bindings for:\nAda\nC\nC++\nC#\nD\nGenie\nGo\nLua\nNim\nOCaml\nPascal\nPerl (via sdl.perl.org)\nPython (via PySDL2.0)\nRust\nVala\nCommon Lisp \n\n\n=== Supported back-ends ===\n\nBecause of the way SDL is designed, much of its source code is split into separate modules for each operating system, to make calls to the underlying system. When SDL is compiled, the appropriate modules are selected for the target system. Following back-ends are available:\nGDI back-end for Microsoft Windows.\nDirectX back-end; but SDL 1.2 requires DirectX 7 by default. Sam Lantinga has stated that he plans to use DirectX 8 in future SDL releases.\nQuartz back-end for macOS.\nXlib back-end for X11-based windowing system on various operating systems.\nOpenGL contexts on various platforms.\nEGL back-end when used in conjunction with Wayland-based windowing system., Raspberry Pi and other systems.\nsceGu back-end, a Sony OpenGL-like backend native to the PSP.\nSDL 1.2 has support for RISC OS (dropped in 2.0).\nAn unofficial Sixel back-end is available for SDL 1.2.\n\n\n== Reception and adoption ==\n\nOver the years SDL was used for many commercial and non-commercial video game projects, for instance MobyGames listed 120 games using SDL in 2013 and the SDL website itself listed around 700 games in 2012. Important commercial examples are Angry Birds or Unreal Tournament, from the open source domain OpenTTD, The Battle for Wesnoth or Freeciv.\nThe cross-platform game releases of the popular Humble Indie Bundles for Linux, Mac and Android are often SDL based.\nSDL is also often used for later ports on new platforms with existing legacy code, for instance the PC game Homeworld was ported to the Pandora handheld and Jagged Alliance 2 for Android via SDL.\nAlso, several non video game software uses SDL, examples are the emulators DOSBox and VisualBoyAdvance.\nThere were several books written for the development with SDL (see further readings).\nSDL is used in university courses teaching multimedia and computer science, for instance, in a workshop about game programming using libSDL at the University of Cadiz in 2010, or a Game Design discipline at UTFPR (Ponta Grossa campus) in 2015.\n\n\n=== Video game examples using SDL ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAlberto García Serrano: Programación de videojuegos en SDL, Ediversitas, ISBN 84-95836-08-4 (Spanish)\nErnest Pazera: Focus On SDL, Muska & Lipman/Premier-Trade, ISBN 1-59200-030-4\nRon Penton: Data Structures for Game Programmers, Muska & Lipman/Premier-Trade, ISBN 1-931841-94-2 (game programming examples with SDL)\nJohn R.

A winger, Armstrong made his Arsenal debut in 1962 at the age of 17 and went on to make 621 appearances – which was then an all-time club record – before he left Highbury in 1977. He spent a season each with Leicester City and Stockport County, and then took up coaching, both domestically and abroad. After a year as Kuwait national team manager, Armstrong returned to Arsenal as reserve-team coach in 1990, a post which he held for the remaining ten years of his life.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nArmstrong was born in Hebburn, County Durham. After leaving school he took up an apprenticeship as an electrician and played works football. He had an unsuccessful trial with Grimsby Town, and was on the books of Newcastle United as an amateur, before signing for Arsenal early in the 1961–62 season.\nArmstrong arrived at Highbury as an inside forward but was soon switched to the wing. He made his senior debut while still only 17, against Blackpool on 24 February 1962 in a match that Arsenal won 1–0. Although he started out as understudy to Johnny MacLeod and Alan Skirton, by the 1963–64 season he had become a regular in the side, and in 1964–65 he missed only two matches.\nOver time Armstrong became one of Arsenal\'s most consistent players, who was noted for the quality and accuracy of his crossing and corner kicks, as well as for his tireless running along the wing. He primarily played on the left, but was also effective on the right. Signed by George Swindin but maturing under Billy Wright\'s management, he was one of several players from the Wright era such as Jon Sammels and Peter Storey who became an integral part of successor Bertie Mee\'s Arsenal side.\nAfter losing two successive League Cup finals, in 1967–68 and 1968–69, Armstrong was instrumental in the Gunners winning the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and was voted Arsenal\'s Player of the Year for 1970. He played in every match the following season as Arsenal completed the League and FA Cup double, and according to the club\'s website, "it was estimated that [he] had a hand in more than half of the goals scored in the Double season". These included Ray Kennedy\'s winning header in the last match of the season, against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, that won Arsenal the League title.\nArmstrong remained with the club through the 1970s, as Arsenal failed to win any further trophies after their Double win; he played at least thirty matches in each season he was at the club during that decade. However, after falling out with Mee\'s successor, Terry Neill, he moved to Leicester City in September 1977 for £15,000. He played only 14 League matches in his single season with the Foxes, and finished his career with Stockport County before retiring in 1979.\nHaving spent fifteen full seasons at Arsenal, most of them as an ever-present, Armstrong set a all-time club record for appearances – 621 competitive first-team appearances, which included exactly 500 in the league; his record has since been overtaken only by David O\'Leary and Tony Adams. He also scored 68 goals for Arsenal. His profile on the club\'s website suggests he was "one of the most accomplished players never to have won a full cap" for England, despite being capped at youth level and five times for the under-23 team; this was attributed to England manager Alf Ramsey\'s policy of not using wingers.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nAfter retiring as a player, Armstrong moved into coaching, and worked for clubs including Fulham, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and Queens Park Rangers. He managed Enderby Town and Norwegian club FK Mjølner, and managed the Kuwaiti national team between 1988 and 1989. In 1990, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he returned to England, where he rejoined Arsenal as reserve team coach, a post which he retained for the rest of his life, despite the club\'s many managerial upheavals. During his time coaching at Arsenal Armstrong was responsible for bringing many young players through the ranks, including Steve Morrow, Ray Parlour and Paul Dickov.\nOn 31 October 2000, Armstrong collapsed after a brain haemorrhage while taking a training session. He died in Hemel Hempstead Hospital during the early hours of the following morning. He was survived by his wife, Marjorie, and their two children, Jill and Tom. A pitch at Arsenal\'s London Colney training ground has been named in his memory.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nArsenal\nFootball League Cup runners-up: 1967–68, 1968–69\nInter-Cities Fairs Cup: 1969–70\nFootball League First Division: 1970–71\nFA Cup: 1970–71\n\n\n=== Individual ===\nArsenal Player of the Year: 1970\n\n\n== References ==', 'Neofunctionalism is a theory of regional integration, building on the work of Ernst B. Haas, a German-born American political scientist, and also Leon Lindberg, an American political scientist. The explicit purpose of the neofunctionalists was to utilize the pioneering European experience of integration to generate hypotheses for testing in other contexts. Jean Monnet\'s approach to European integration, which aimed at integrating individual sectors in hopes of achieving spillover effects to further the process of integration, is said to have followed the neofunctional school\'s tack. Haas later declared the theory of neofunctionalism obsolete, a statement he revoked in his final book, after the process of European integration started stalling in the 1960s, when Charles de Gaulle\'s "empty chair" politics paralyzed the institutions of the European Coal and Steel Community, European Economic Community, and European Atomic Energy Community. The theory was updated and further specified namely by Wayne Sandholtz, Alec Stone Sweet, and their collaborators in the 1990s and in the 2000s (references below). The main contributions of these authors was an employment of empiricism.\nNeofunctionalism describes and explains the process of regional integration with reference to how three causal factors interact:\nGrowing economic interdependence between nations\nOrganizational capacity to resolve disputes and build international legal regimes\nSupranational market rules that replace national regulatory regimes\nEarly neofunctionalist theory assumed a decline in importance of nationalism and the nation-state; it predicted that, gradually, elected officials, interest groups, and large commercial interests within states would see it in their interests to pursue welfarist objectives best satisfied by the political and market integration at a higher, supranational level. Haas theorized three mechanisms that he thought would drive the integration forward: positive spillover, the transfer of domestic allegiances and technocratic automaticity.\nPositive spillover effect is the notion that integration between states in one economic sector will create strong incentives for integration in further sectors, in order to fully capture the perks of integration in the sector in which it started.\nIncreased number of transactions and intensity of negotiations then takes place hand in hand with increasing regional integration. This leads to a creation of institutions that work without reference to "local" governments.\nThe mechanism of a transfer in domestic allegiances can be best understood by first noting that an important assumption within neofunctionalist thinking is of a pluralistic society within the relevant nation states. Neofunctionalists claim that as the process of integration gathers pace, interest groups and associations will transfer their allegiances away from national institutions towards the supranational European institutions. They will do this because they will, in theory, come to realise that these newly formed institutions are a better conduit through which to pursue their material interests.\nGreater regulatory complexity is then needed and other institutions on regional level are usually called for. This causes integration to be transferred to higher levels of decision-making processes.\nTechnocratic automaticity described the way in which, as integration proceeds, the supranational institutions set up to oversee that integration process will themselves take the lead in sponsoring further integration as they become more powerful and more autonomous of the member states. In the Haas-Schmitter model, size of unit, rate of transactions, pluralism, and elite complementarity are the background conditions on which the process of integration depends.\nJust as Rosamond put it, political integration will then become an "inevitable" side effect of integration in economic sectors.\nNeofunctionalism was modified and updated in two important books that helped to revive the study of European integration: European Integration and Supranational Governance (1998), and The Institutionalization of Europe (2001). Wayne Sandholtz and Alec Stone Sweet describe and assess the evolution of Neofunctionalist theory and empirical research in their 2009 paper, Neo-functionalism and Supranational Governance.\n\n\n== Intergovernmentalism ==\nIntergovernmentalism is an alternative theory of political integration, where power in international organizations is possessed by the member-states and decisions are made unanimously. Independent appointees of the governments or elected representatives have solely advisory or implementational functions. Intergovernmentalism is used by most international organizations today. An alternative method of decision-making in international organizations is supranationalism.\nIntergovernmentalism is also a theory on European integration which rejects the Neofunctionalist mechanisms of integration. The theory, initially proposed by Stanley Hoffmann and refined by Andrew Moravcsik suggests that governments control the level and speed of European integration. Any increase in power at supranational level, he argues, results from a direct decision by governments who make decisions based on a domestic agenda. The theory rejects the spillover-effect argument and the idea that supranational organisations wield political influence on par with that of national governments.\nNeofunctionalists have criticized intergovernmentalism on theoretical grounds as well as on the basis of empirical evidence, which they claim demonstrates that intergovernmentalism is incapable of explaining the dynamics and trajectory of European integration. Today, approaches with affinities to neofunctionalism dominate the study of European integration, and especially regarding the European Union\'s legal system, while research on intergovernmentalism is sparse.\nIn the last decades Haas\' theory has been revived by several authors, who describe the neofunctionalist theoretical legacy left by him as able to speak directly to current EU studies and comparative regionalism, if it is seen as a dynamic theory that corresponds to established social scientific norms with disciplinary openness.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHaas, Ernst B., ed.

Joe Hani, one of the admins of \'Taking Back South Africa!\' said when questioned by the Mail&Guardian newspaper as to the motivation behind Occupy South Africa that "no country was more worthy of an uprising against capitalism than South Africa". Ayanda Kota, the chairperson of the Unemployed People\'s Movement said: ""We, the poor, suffer whenever companies fix the price of bread or when there are more job losses while chief executives get rich. But our protest is also localised, in the sense that we are protesting about the R19-million that is unaccounted for by the Makana municipality, the R240 000 spent by local government on bogus soccer development clinics and the privatisation of our struggle by the ANC." Richard Pithouse, a Rhodes University political scientist, said the Grahamstown occupation protest could stand out as an example to other cities. It had been preceded by months of careful political work involving the Unemployed Peoples\' Movement and the Students for Social Justice. This had culminated in "a negotiated solidarity based on equality" between disillusioned middle-class youth and grassroots communities, which had "explosive political potential".\n\n\n=== Occupy Johannesburg ===\n\nAround two hundred occupiers gathered outside the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and gave speeches over a microphone claiming to be of the 99% and they were very angry with the corporates and the politicians. Police later told the protesters they had to disperse or face arrest. There were problems related to the retreat point also at which point the occupiers decided to disperse and return another day. In attendance were activists from Soweto and Thembelihle, the Democratic Left Front had a prominent presence and members of Zeitgeist and September National Imbizo/Blackwash were in attendance as well.\nAndrew Bennie of the Democratic Left Front movement (DLF)noted in an interview with ABN news that South Africa\'s class divide was worse than many countries also Occupying.\nThe South African Civil Society Information Service (SACSIS) also attended.\n\n\n=== Occupy Cape Town ===\nAround 200 attended with people coming and going throughout the day. A hot speaker was set up and speeches were given from occupiers from various backgrounds and ideologies. Police mingled past but did not intervene. City police stopped people bringing a trailer in and tried to tell a crafter not to sell his wire beaded flowers but the occupiers insisted he be allowed to stay. At the occupation were members of community organisations from Blikiesdorp and Manenburg, Zeitgesters, Anarchists, and Blackwash members amongst others.\nFollowing occupations in Cape Town were held in Thibault Square.\nMario Wanza, of \'Proudly Manenberg\' and one of the organizers of Occupy Cape Town stated that "People have started realising that political parties don’t have the answers. They make speeches everyday but nothing happens. Our lives don’t get any better, our lives get worse. What is important is that this is a growing movement of change and we have given up on the government solving our problems. We have given up on the rich solving our problems. We are the only ones that can change things in this country."\n\n\n=== Occupy Durban ===\nActivist Sarah Dawson reported that Durban had a steady flow of occupiers through the day, and had some really interesting discussions, and the occupiers had the opportunity to inform passers by about the movement. There were some natural arguments about what the movement is directed towards, but a general consensus that diversity should accommodated, and that the movement is about acknowledging a problem. Things were peaceful and spirits were high for the most part. Between 50 and 100 people occupied. Discussions were had about the possibility of making it a weekly occurrence into the future and seeking greater cooperation with other civil society groups and grassroot movements. There were children, guitarists and a slam poet.\nSarah Dawson argued on behalf of the largely middle class attendance that "The movement is clearly not about “The Poor” with a capital P, but about a systemic problem. The 99% consists of people at every end of the spectrum, who have diverse experiences and responsibilities, but who acknowledge that their experiences share a cause."\nDuring the Cop 17 climate talks of December 2011, the occupation seemed to become more serious in Durban.\n\n\n=== Occupy Grahamstown ===\nMbali Baduza from Students for Social Justice reported that an initial group of 20 Rhodes University students gathered at the Botanical Gardens at 10 am. After having distributed T-shirts they made their way down to High Street to meet the masses (Unemployed People\'s Movement comrades and many others). As they walked down they chanted "Enough is Enough. We want our country back". While they walked down High Street, they distributed pamphlets which contained information about why the demonstration was happening and why it was necessary.\nWhen they reached the crowd gathered at the Cathedral (about 30–40 people) they all merged and sang protest songs for about an hour. Together they marched up and down high street and the louder they sang, the more people from the street joined. People of all races.\nOn their return to the cathedral, the floor was opened up to the crowd to share their grievances. People from Phaphamani, Vukani and other locations spoke mainly about their need for 3 essentials: electricity, water and housing.\nThey then made their way to the Makana Municipal buildings and chanted "Amandla, ngawethu! Amanga ngawabo!" Richard Pithouse and Ayanda Kota addressed the crowd and spoke about how although the government officials were not present, they would hear of the day\'s events. It was more of a symbolic gesture. Ayanda Kota and some UPM comrades went into the municipal buildings and threw shit inside to protest the bucket system and this was broadcast on South African news.\nAfter that activity, the police came and asked the crowd to leave.\nBen Fogel stated that Occupy Grahamstown offers hope to the South Africa left, as it shows that radical students and the poor can form a political alliance based upon equality and solidarity.\n\n\n=== Occupy East London ===\nChloe Menteath stated that five people later to be six stood underneath the East London Steve Biko Statue and in front of the Imperialists Old Shack. The small group shouted slogans out for an hour and a half while curious passers by looked on.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOccupy movement\nWe are the 99%\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOccupy South Africa\nTaking Back South Africa!', 'Raghunathbari Ramtarak High School is a high school in Raghunathbari, Purba Medinipur district, in the Indian state of West Bengal.

The Czech version of the game was released in 2007 by Czech Games Edition, and a German version was published in the same year by Heidelberger Spieleverlag.\nVlaada Chvatil developed a video game version in 2014. It was released on 7 October 2014 for iPad, on 24 December 2014 for iPhone and Android and on 14 April 2015 for Windows Phone.\n\n\n== Game Description ==\nCorporation Incorporated is a construction firm that builds sewer systems and low-income houses on under-developed planets. Galaxy Corp Inc. has been on the verge of bankruptcy which has resulted in the company transporting building materials to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is highest. Corporation Incorporated was saved by a few individuals who decided to not ship the materials to the edge of Galaxy and instead build the materials into spacecraft and let them ship themselves. The players now just sign a contract, and then gain access to Corp Inc. Warehouse. The player can build their own space ship from the available prefabricated materials and fly it to the Periphery (edge of the Galaxy). The player may lose money, but any gains made are theirs to keep, and Corporation Incorporated will pay a bonus for quick delivery. It’s possible that the player will end up with an immense amount of debt and end up begging for money on the street or they may just might find themselves among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy. \n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is played in three (or up to four with expansions) rounds with later rounds having bigger ships but more difficult travel. Each round consists of three phases: building, space travel, settlement. Before every round, four decks of card are prepared (3 public and 1 secret) and Evil machinations cards from expansion could be added.\n\n\n=== Building phase ===\nMain phase of the game where players will construct their ship. In the beginning, all tiles are face down and all players are picking and building simultaneously. Hourglasses keep players under time pressure as faster building players can limit time available. A player who builds at least one tile can pick a public deck to check the dangers ahead.\n\n\n=== Flight ===\nAll decks are shuffled together and played one by one by the leading player. Cards contains both positive and negative effects (meteor showers, planets with goods, battlezones, slavers, pirates) that can bring money and goods or remove pieces of ship (that must be repaid) or even force a player to return home.\n\n\n=== Settlement ===\nAfter flight, players receive bonuses for fastest delivery or the nicest ship and can sell goods. Also they have to settle payments for lost tiles.\n\n\n== Expansions ==\n\n\n=== The Big Expansion (2008) ===\nThis expansion adds new features:\nnew ship designs (1A ship and 2A fleet) and ship parts (like shield or laser boosters)\n5 player support\nnew Adventure cards\nEvil machinations cards - optional player-selectable cards that allows more customized deck\nRough Roads Ahead cards to increase difficulty\nBlue aliens race with unique roles like diplomat or lawyer\n\n\n=== Another Big Expansion (2012) ===\nfourth round\nnew ships designs\n2B - cylindrical ship with no sides (border parts are connected)\n3B - Amoeba - ship with holes depending on dice cast before the build phase\n4B - big ship or fleet made by combining of the two boards (back-side of 2B and 3B) with final shape decided during build phase\n\nnew Adventure cards with boarding parties and new ship components like Armory or Security Stations to stop them\nsupport crew\n\n\n=== Latest Models (2013) ===\nSmall expansion based on new ship designs.\n1C/2C - two designs sharing the same board with space-time anomaly in the middle\n3C - death star design (square board with parts connected over the edges)\n4C - combines board with back-sides of 1C/2C and 3C - ship or fleet with final topology dependent on dice cast during building\n\n\n=== Missions (2015) ===\nSmall expansion based on missions introduced by the digital versions. Expansion contains mission cards and special tiles (like radioactive cargo or metal ingots).\n\n\n== Video game (2014) ==\nThe version for iPad was released in October 2014, with releases for iPhone and Android following in December 2014 and for Windows Phone in April 2015. It features a bit changed gameplay and a basic Plot. Expansion Alien technologies was released as in August 2016.\n\n\n=== Gameplay ===\nThe game features two Phases - the Ship building and Space Travel. The Player builds Ship from junk to get ready for trip as best as he can. Like the board game, players are building the ship in realtime but there is possibility to choose turn-based mode similar to the original game. The second phase is the trip. Player has to gain highest score by getting to the destination before his rivals or by getting more valuable goods. It is possible to play Single-player or Multi-player. The game also features a story campaign.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nThe game has received very positive reviews. It currently holds 87% on Metacritic and gained some Awards including the best Czech video game of the year by Games.cz and Readers Choice by Board Game Geek.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGalaxy Trucker at BoardGameGeek', 'The Wishkah River is a tributary of the Chehalis River, approximately 40 miles (64 km) long, in the U.S. state of Washington.

Climate commitment studies attempt to assess the amount of future global warming that is "committed" under the assumption of some constant level of forcings. The constant level often used for illustrative purposes is CO2 doubling or quadrupling; or the present level of forcing.\n\n\n== Basic idea ==\nIf a perturbation — such as an increase in greenhouse gases or solar activity — is applied to the climate system the response will not be immediate, principally because of the large heat capacity (i.e., thermal inertia) of the oceans.\nAs an analogue, consider the heating of a thin metal plate (by the sun or by a flame): the plate will warm relatively quickly. If a thick metal block is heated instead, it will take much longer for the entire block to reach equilibrium with the imposed heating because of its higher heat capacity.\nLand only stores heat in the top few meters. Ocean water, by contrast, can move vertically and store heat within the ocean\'s depth (convection). This is why the land surface is observed to warm more than the oceans. It also explains the very large difference in response between\n"equilibrium" climate prediction runs in which only a shallow ocean is used and it is assumed that the climate has come to equilibrium and\n"transient" climate prediction runs in which a full ocean is used and the climate is out of balance.\nThe "commitment" can apply to variables other than temperature: because of the long mixing time for heat into the deep ocean, a given surface warming commits to centuries of sea level rise from thermal expansion of the ocean. Also once a certain threshold is crossed, it is likely that a slow melting of the Greenland ice sheet will commit us to a sea level rise of 5m over millennia.\n\n\n== Models ==\n\nRecent models forecast that even in the unlikely event of greenhouse gases stabilizing at present levels, the earth would warm by an additional 0.5°C by 2100, a similar rise in temperature to that seen during the 20th century. In 2050, as much as 64% of that commitment would be due to past natural forcings. Over time, their contribution compared to the human influence will diminish. Overall, the warming commitment at 2005 greenhouse gas levels could exceed 1°C. As ocean waters expand in response to this warming, global sea levels would mount by about 10 centimeters during that time. These models do not take into account ice cap and glacier melting; including those climate feedback effects would give a 1–1.5°C estimated temperature increase.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis is by no means a new idea, the concept is discussed in the IPCC TAR [1] and in the SAR in 1995.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==', 'The Filthy Critic is a website run by Matt Weatherford under the pseudonym Filthy.

Recurring themes include his constantly shifting state of employment, his loving relationship with his wife, and his interaction with the locals at the "Arvada Tavern". Occasionally The Filthy Critic is "guest-written" by the author\'s fictional relatives, such as his mentally retarded cousin Larry and his nerdy and virginal nephew, Jimmy.\nThe writing style is also notable for its vulgar language and often scathing remarks toward Hollywood.

In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be eligible to stand for an election or be granted ballot access.\nThe first known example of a law enforcing age of candidacy was the Lex Villia Annalis, a Roman law enacted in 180 BCE which set the minimum ages for senatorial magistrates.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nMany youth rights groups view current age of candidacy requirements as unjustified age discrimination. Occasionally people who are younger than the minimum age will run for an office in protest of the requirement or because they don\'t know that the requirement exists. On extremely rare occasions, young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office.\nIn 1934, Rush Holt of West Virginia was elected to the Senate of the United States at the age of 29. Since the U.S. Constitution requires senators to be at least 30, Holt was forced to wait until his 30th birthday, six months after the start of the session, before being sworn in.\nIn 1954, Richard Fulton won election to the Tennessee Senate. Shortly after being sworn in, Fulton was ousted from office because he was only 27 years old at the time. The Tennessee State Constitution required that senators be at least 30. Rather than hold a new election, the previous incumbent, Clifford Allen, was allowed to resume his office for another term. Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the US House of Representatives where he served for 10 years.\nIn South Carolina, two Senators aged 24 were elected, but were too young according to the State Constitution: Mike Laughlin in 1969 and Bryan Dorn (later a US Congressman) in 1941. They were seated anyway.\nOn several occasions, the Socialist Workers Party (USA) has nominated candidates too young to qualify for the offices they were running for. In 1972, Linda Jenness ran as the SWP presidential candidate, although she was only 31 at the time. Since the U.S. Constitution requires that the President and Vice President be at least 35 years old, Jenness was not able to receive ballot access in several states in which she otherwise qualified. Despite this handicap, Jenness still received 83,380 votes. In 2004, the SWP nominated Arrin Hawkins as the party\'s vice-presidential candidate, although she was only 28 at the time. Hawkins was also unable to receive ballot access in several states due to her age.\n\n\n== Reform efforts ==\nIn the United States, many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, South Dakota voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Representative from 25 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar ballot measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21. In 2002, Oregon voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18.\nDuring the early 2000s, the British Youth Council and other groups successfully campaigned to lower age of candidacy requirements in the United Kingdom. The age of candidacy was reduced from 21 to 18 in England, Wales and Scotland on 1 January 2007, when section 17 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 entered into force.\n\n\n== In various countries ==\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, any person 18 years of age or older may stand for election to public office at federal, state or local government level.\nThe youngest ever member of the House of Representatives was 20-year-old Wyatt Roy elected in the 2010 federal election after the Electoral Act 1918 was amended (in 1973) to reduce the age of candidacy for that office from 21 to 18.\n\n\n=== Austria ===\nIn Austria, a person must be 18 years of age or older to stand in elections to the European Parliament or National Council. The Diets of regional Länder are able to set a minimum age lower than 18 for candidacy in elections to the Diet itself as well as to municipal councils in the Land. In presidential elections the candidacy age is 35.\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nAny Belgian who has reached the age of 21 years can stand for election for the Chamber of Representatives, can become a member of the Senate, or can be elected in one of the regional parliaments.

A person must be at least 18 years old to be appointed to the Senate and must be at least 30 to be President or Vice-President of the Senate. As only members of the House of Representatives are eligible to be appointed Prime Minister, the Prime Minister must be at least 18 years old. A person must also be at least 18 years old to be elected to a village council.\n\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe Brazilian Constitution (Article 14, Section 3 (VI)) defines 35 years as the minimum age for someone to be elected President, Vice-President or Senator; 30 years for state Governor or Vice-Governor; 21 for Federal or State Deputy, Mayor or Vice-Mayor; and 18 for city Councilman.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, any person 18 years of age or older may stand for election to public office.

Grasty owned the Evening News, which he ran for a number of years and later sold prior to acquiring the Minnesota Dispatch and the St. Paul Pioneer Press in separate transactions and later divesting these newspapers to seek ownership of the Sun. Grasty was one of the developers of the Roland Park development, said to be an early innovation in community planning, including planned shopping centers and other aspects of the community prior to development.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCharles H. Grasty was born March 3, 1863 in Fincastle, Virginia, the son of a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend John Sharshall Grasty, and the former Ella Giles Pettus, and as a bright youth taught Latin while in high school. At age 16 he entered University of Missouri to study law, but left before graduating to enter the newspaper business. He stayed on at a summer job reporting for the Mexico Intelligencer paying $6 a week, and then was offered $7 a week to join the Kansas City Star, where he rose to managing editor within 18 months.\nIn 1890 he married Leota Tootle Perrin, a woman with a daughter from another marriage named Sarah Perrin (Sarah Perrin was married to Lieutenant George de Grasse Catlin in Lake Placid New York August 18, 1909). That same year, Grasty became the general manager of the Manufacturers\' Record, a weekly business journal in Baltimore, leaving the Kansas City Star.\n\n\n== Newspaper career ==\nGrasty was involved in developing Roland Park in Baltimore when he also assembled investors to back his acquisition of the Evening News in 1892. Through the Evening News he attacked local political corruption, but maintained political independence. He came out against the Baltimore Sun as a competing newspaper for its willingness to ignore Baltimore political corruption, at the time not knowing that over a decade later he would take control of that newspaper. His efforts to root out corruption in Baltimore politics ensured the loss of power by incumbent Democrats Arthur Pue Gorman, who lost the United States Senate seat from which he had dominated Maryland politics for years. In addition, he saw the unseating of I. Freeman Rasin, Gorman\'s ally and "Boss" in control of Baltimore, who was defeated for City Council. Grasty’s 1893 accusations against Democratic politicians for their involvement in gambling schemes earned him a libel suit, which he won.\nIn the Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904 took down much of the city\'s central business district including the Evening News Building, built 1871 with its distinctive mansard roof and corner clock tower at East Baltimore and South Streets, just across the corner from The Suns famous "Iron Building", a precursor of modern steel skyscrapers, built in 1851. Baltimore and South Streets had been the nexus of the "Newspaper Wars" for most of the latter half of the 19th Century between the competing dailies with its bulletin boards, posters, chalk board placards across the second story level of the buildings with the latest telegraphed information of election results, sports scores and far-away war news with "Newsies", small and teen-age boys hawking papers along the sidewalks. The Washington Post agreed to print \'The News, and Grasty turned to Adolph S. Ochs, publisher of The New York Times to use the unused printing facilities of the Philadelphia Times. Ochs essentially gave Grasty the machinery. Grasty rebuilt the News and reopened within weeks. It is said that within 16 hours of the Fire, Grasty had acquired a new plant and three new printing presses for $150,000. "First Press Is Here", Baltimore American, Feb. 12, 1904; Charles Grasty to Richard Mansfield, June 30, 1906, NYPL/ms; See Mencken: the American iconoclast By Marion Elizabeth Rodgers.\nOn June 18, 1906, Grasty and Gen. Felix Agnus (owner of the ancient Baltimore American teamed up to purchase The Baltimore Herald at the northwest corner of St. Paul and East Fayette Streets whose building had been ruined by the Fire, just across to the west from the untouched new massive City Circuit Courthouse, just completed four years earlier on the northern edge of the "Burnt District". They promptly shut it down, putting its nascent editor H.L. Mencken out of work for a time and divided its assets for their existing newspapers. https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F6061EFD355A12738DDDA10994DE405B868CF1D3\nGrasty sold the News on 27 February 1908 to chain-maker Frank A. Munsey for $1,500,000. Grasty attempted to remain on as general manager, but resigned within weeks due to disagreements. Later in 1908 he bought a half-interest in a Minnesota evening paper called the Dispatch. Early the next year he bought the St. Paul Pioneer Press, which had both morning and evening editions, and combined its evening edition with the Dispatch. Grasty’s style was not well accepted in the Twin Cities and he soon sold the papers back to their original owners and took an extended trip to Europe. However, Grasty was already eyeing the Baltimore Sun, which was still run by the Abell family. Grasty found investors and struck a deal with the Sun founders to leave them with a majority stake, but took for himself preferred shares that guaranteed absolute control of The Sun by him personally. The Abells relented out of fear that Grasty would roll up the local competing papers and compete against The Sun.\nAfter taking control of the Sun, Grasty acquired the Baltimore World at auction in April 1910 for $63,000, overpaying, but fearing a play by William Randolph Hearst to enter the Baltimore market.\nGrasty retired in 1915 and went to Europe as a war correspondent for the Kansas City Star. He returned to the U.S. in 1916, served as the Treasurer for the New York Times, before boredom caused him to return to Europe and his work as a war correspondent. In 1918 he published a book, Flashes from the Front. He continued living in London and working as a war correspondent for the Times until his death. He wrote a number of pieces that were published in the Atlantic while he was a correspondent in London.\n\n\n== Roland Park ==\nGrasty was one of the investors of Roland Park, a suburban development in Baltimore at about the same time that he first acquired the Evening News. Grasty lived at Fryer and Caprons in Roland Park, which today is the corner of Woodlawn Ave and Upland. The Roland Park development was said to be an innovation in early development of planned communities. Schlack, H. G. "Planning Roland Park, 1891-1900." Maryland Historical Magazine 67 (Winter 1972): 419-28. http://www.rolandpark.org/rphistory.html. Roland Park included a "store block" arranged in a linear pattern along a street to serve the commercial needs of a planned residential community.

In 1914, after the death of President Woodrow Wilson’s first wife Ellen, Grasty telegrammed the President with his regrets. A letter signed by Wilson on White House letterhead thanks Mr. Grasty for this.\n\n\n=== Letter signed by Woodrow Wilson ===\nAuction for a letter to Grasty signed by Woodrow Wilson https://web.archive.org/web/20110712034413/http://www.galleryofhistory.com/archive/7_2005/presidents/30768-PRESIDENT-WOODROW-WILSON.htm Acknowledging sympathy upon the death of the First Lady.\nThe White House, Washington, 1914 August 15. To Charles H. Grasty, Baltimore. In full: "I want you to know how real a comfort it was to me to get your telegram of sympathy. It is very delightful to feel the warm touch of a friend\'s hand at such a time, and your telegram has served to give me strength and courage." Nine days earlier, on August 6, 1914, Wilson\'s first wife, Ellen Louise Axson Wilson, had died of Bright\'s disease at the age of 54. She was the last First Lady to die while her husband was President.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nHis life was that of a newspaperman. He was in the business from the time he was about 17 until his death at 61 years old. He ran papers from the perspective and ethic of a reporter. He was an idealist, and even in his bid for control of the Sunpapers, his focus for control was not financial, but an effort to ensure that he could separate editorial control from investor involvement. His retirement was that of a war correspondent, a well-informed writer, who is said to be the most informed in all of Europe in the years before his death. His leadership touched into Baltimore politics, and helped Wilson’s bid for presidential election. His name is associated with The Baltimore Sun, Evening News, Kansas City Star, New York Times, Washington Post, and half-dozen other regional newspapers. From 1900 to 1910, Grasty was a director of the Associated Press. Few men in newspaper history have the same resume. Grasty was among the greatest names of American industrialists in one book, which closed his biographical chapter by saying, "Mr. Grasty justly occupies a place as one of the real captains of American industry." 130 Pen Pictures of Live Men https://books.google.com/books?id=IOQDAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA174&ots=Wbze-FU2TJ&dq=charles%20grasty%20baltimore%20sun&pg=PA174#v=onepage&q&f=false\nFrom 1915 until his death in 1924, Grasty lived mostly in London, where he also died. He was known as the local connection for information, and was at the Versailles Peace Conference near Paris in 1919 to discuss the issues ending World War I.\nWhile living in London, Grasty fathered a daughter with an Englishwoman named Louisa Bennett. This, his only daughter, Joan Bennett Grasty was born in 1919. Grasty and his wife Leota had no natural children together. Grasty remain involved in the life of his daughter, and paid for Joan\'s education in France and later moved Joan and her mother Louisa to the United States, where he financed their living, eventually leaving Joan "Winifred" Bennett Grasty as his sole heir. Joan Grasty became a world traveler, attended University of Southern California, was a one-time Hollywood actress and later supported Ronald Reagan in his successful bid for California Governor. Joan Grasty had only one child, Pete Robinson. His great-grandchildren are still living.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGrasty died January 19, 1924, and while many things were said about him at the time of his death, and after, the Sun’s editorial after his death stated:\n"Probably no citizen of Baltimore ever performed greater public services. Our municipal government today, whatever its defects, is at least a hundred times as honest, intelligent and efficient as it was in 1892. For that change we may thank Charles H. Grasty more than we may thank any other man.... His monument belongs in Baltimore, not in New York or in London, where he served the Times so long. He left an indelible mark upon journalism here, and he left a no less indelible mark upon municipal history. He changed our newspapers and he changed our politics, and both changes were for the better."\n\n\n== Career highlights ==\nManaging editor, Kansas City Star (1884–1889)\nPublisher, Baltimore Evening News (1892–1908),\nSt. Paul Dispatch and St. Paul Pioneer Press (1908–1909)\nPresident and general manager, Baltimore Sunpapers (1910–1914)\nWar correspondent, Kansas City Star and Associated Press (1915–1916)\nTreasurer, New York Times (1916–1917)\nSpecial editorial correspondent, New York Times (1917–1924)\nDirector, Associated Press (1915–1916)\n\n\n== Books ==\nFlashes from the Front (New York: Century, 1918). http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/charles-henry-grasty/flashes-from-the-front-sar/1-flashes-from-the-front-sar.shtml\nCited as a source for http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Literary_Digest_History_of_the_World_War/Sources\n\n\n== See also ==\nDana Robinson, Esq., great-grandson\'s Charles Grasty page: https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222952/http://www.danarobinson.com/charlesgrasty/ http://www.danarobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/grastyteamphoto.png\n\n\n== References ==\nDictionary of Literary Biography Daniel W.

He has made 632 appearances in the Football League, including 464 for Rochdale, for whom he holds the all-time record for the most appearances.\nIn his 20-year-long playing career, Jones has previously played for Caernarfon Town, Swansea City, Barnsley, Bradford City and Notts County.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Caernarfon Town ===\nBorn in Birkenhead, Merseyside, Jones started his career with Caernarfon Town in the 1996–97 season before moving to Swansea City.\n\n\n=== Swansea City ===\nHe stayed at Swansea City for one season but during the second half of the season he was loaned to Rochdale.\n\n\n=== Rochdale ===\nWhile on loan Jones made his Rochdale debut on 17 January 1998, in a 3–1 defeat against Peterborough United. Jones signed a permanent deal with Rochdale after the end of the season. Jones spent three years in his first stint with the Lancashire club.\n\n\n=== Barnsley ===\nIn 2001, Jones was transferred to Barnsley, joining up with former Rochdale manager Steve Parkin. Jones stayed at Barnsley for three seasons without making many appearances and in 2003 he went back on loan to his former club Rochdale.\n\n\n=== Rochdale Return ===\nIn 2004, he re-joined Rochdale on a permanent deal and went on to become the club captain. Jones holds the record for most appearances for Rochdale and is regarded by the fans as a true Rochdale A.F.C. legend due to his long tenure with the club, his commitment and determined style of play, and his leadership on the pitch. His qualities within the Rochdale squad during the 2009–10 season played a large part in helping the club to earn promotion into League One. Jones scored a brilliant volley at St Mary\'s against managerless Southampton on 4 September 2010, which he described as "the best I\'ve ever struck". Jones was Rochdale\'s top scorer in the 2010–11 season, Rochdale\'s first season in the third tier of English football for 36 years, and was praised by manager Keith Hill for his outstanding contributions.\n\n\n=== Bradford City ===\nOn 22 June 2012, it was announced that Jones would sign for Bradford City on a one-year contract. On 11 August 2012, he made his Bradford debut in the League Cup in a 1–0 win against Notts County. He made his league debut a week later against Gillingham. He made his home debut on 21 August in a 1–0 win against Fleetwood Town, providing the assist for the only goal of the game, taking the corner that James Hanson scored from. On 25 August, he was named man of the match in a 5–1 win against AFC Wimbledon. He scored his first goal for the club on 18 September 2012, scoring a free-kick in a 3–1 win against Morecambe, and in the process helped Bradford to their best start to a season at home since 1957. He scored his second goal for the club in a 1–0 win against Plymouth Argyle on 20 November. On 11 December 2012, Jones captained Bradford in a historic win over Premier League side Arsenal in the League Cup. He then lead the team to a 4–3 victory over two legs against Aston Villa in the semi-finals. It was only the second time the team have played at Wembley, the last time being in 1996 when Bradford won the Second Division play-off final. Bradford were the first team from the fourth-tier of English football to reach a Wembley final and only the second team from the fourth-tier to reach a major final, the only other team to achieve this feat is Jones\' former club Rochdale who reached the League Cup final in 1962. Bradford lost the final to Jones\' former club Swansea City. Jones was voted player of the year for the 2012–13 season. On 9 May 2014 it was announced that Jones would not be offered a new contract at the club and would leave at the end of the 13/14 season.\n\n\n=== Notts County ===\nHe moved to Notts County on 7 August 2014, signing a one-year contract. Jones made his County debut only two days later on 9 August 2014, in a 1–1 draw against Preston North End. He made his home debut on 16 August in a 0–1 defeat against Fleetwood Town. He scored his first goal for the club on 23 August 2015 in a 0–2 win against Port Vale. He scored his second goal for the club in a 5–3 win against Crawley Town on 18 October. He played 42 times for County in the league that season, scoring three goals as they finished twenty-first behind Crewe Alexandra by two points, and were relegated to League Two.\n\n\n=== Southport ===\nOn 6 August 2015, Jones agreed to join National League side Southport. After a successful first season with the club, he signed on to stay with the club for the 2016/17 season and was appointed club captain by manager Andy Bishop.\n\n\n=== Altrincham ===\nOn 9 December 2016, Jones signed a month-long loan deal with Altrincham.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGary Jones at Soccerbase', 'Paracroton zeylanicus is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae that is endemic to south-western parts of Sri Lanka. It was first found from a Hinidumkanda Biosphere Reserve, but rapidly declined due to deforestation and other anthropogenic activities. The plant is listed as a critically endangered by IUCN.\n\n\n== References ==', 'Sekhemre Sementawy Djehuti (also Djehuty and other variants) was possibly the second king of the Theban 16th Dynasty reigning over parts of Upper Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. Alternatively, he may be a king of the late 13th Dynasty or the fourth king of the 17th Dynasty. Djehuty is credited with a reign of 3 years in the first entry of the 11th column of the Turin canon. According to Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker, he was succeeded by Sobekhotep VIII.\n\n\n== Chronological position ==\nDjehuti\'s dynasty remains debated. Indeed, on this point, the Turin Canon is open to interpretations. There are several kings recorded with the name "Sekhemre[...]" and the damage to the original document does not preserve the complete name. As a result, Djehuti, named Sekhemre Sementawy, may in principle correspond to any "Sekhemre[...]" preserved on the king list, i.e. may be a ruler of the 13th, 16th and even 17th Dynasty.\nThe Egyptologists Darrell Baker and Kim Ryholt believe that he was part of the 16th Dynasty, which controlled the Theban region after 1650 BC. Alternatively, two studies by Claude Vandersleyen and Christina Geisen date Djehuti\'s reign to the very end of the Memphite 13th Dynasty. Geisen\'s datation relies on stylistic considerations of his queen\'s coffin, which however, Stephen Quirke argues, uses unproven assumptions. An older theory of Jürgen von Beckerath, whose conclusions are shared by Hans Stock, contends that Djehuti was a ruler of the early 17th Dynasty, which arose in Upper Egypt after the collapse of 16th Dynasty following the short-lived Hyksos conquest of Thebes. This theory is supported by the discovery of the tomb of Djehuti\'s queen, Mentuhotep, which is located in Dra\' Abu el-Naga\', a necropolis usually associated with the 17th Dynasty. Scholars such as Chris Bennett however, point out that this does not necessarily mean that Djehuti was buried in Dra\' Abu el-Naga\' as well.\nSome Egyptologists proposed that Djehuti was married to a granddaughter of the vizier Ibiaw who served under the 13th Dynasty king Wahibre Ibiau c. 1712 - 1701 BC, and was thus most likely two generations removed from this king. In more recent times, however, it was pointed out that the link between Ibiaw and Djehuti\'s consort Mentuhotep is still unproven and that the proposed temporal correlation between Wahibre Ibiau and Djehuti remains conjectural.\n\n\n== Attestations ==\n\nDjehuti is attested on the Turin canon and the Karnak king list. All of Djehuti\'s contemporary attestions come from a 145 kilometres (90 mi) long stretch of the Nile valley from Deir el-Ballas in the north to Edfu in the south. This roughly corresponds to the territory in the sphere of influence of the rulers of the 16th dynasty. Djehuti\'s nomen and prenomen are known from a single block discovered by Flinders Petrie in Deir el-Ballas. A painted block bearing Djehuti\'s cartouche and showing him wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt – far beyond his sphere of influence – was uncovered in Edfu and otherwise, Djehuti is only attested by objects from his wife\'s burial. Queen Mentuhotep\'s tomb was found intact in 1822 and her (now lost) coffin was inscribed with one of the earliest cases of the texts from the Book of the Dead. Mentuhotep\'s cosmetic box bears Djehuti\'s nomen, prenomen and cartouche together with funerary formulae and an inscription revealing that the box was a gift from the king.\nIt has been suggested that the unattributed Southern South Saqqara pyramid may have been built for Djehuti. This hypothesis is based on a fragmentary inscription found within the pyramid and reading "Weserkha...", a possible reference to Weserkhau i.e. Djehuti\'s Golden Horus name.\n\n\n== References ==', '"The Perfect Kiss" is a song by the English alternative dance and rock band New Order. It was recorded at Britannia Row Studios in London and released on 13 May 1985.  It is the first New Order song to be included on a studio album, Low-Life, at the same time as its release as a single. The vinyl version has Factory catalogue number FAC 123 and the video has the opposite number, FAC 321.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWhile widely regarded as a centrepiece of New Order\'s catalogue, "The Perfect Kiss" reached only #46 in the UK charts.\nThe song\'s themes include love "We believe in a land of love" and death "the perfect kiss is the kiss of death". The overall meaning of the song is unclear to its writer today. In an interview with GQ Magazine Bernard Sumner said "I haven\'t a clue what this is about." He agreed with the interviewer that his best known lyric is in the song: "Pretending not to see his gun/I said, \'Let\'s go out and have some fun\'". The lyrics, he added, came about after the band was visiting a man\'s house in the United States who showed his guns under his bed before they went out for an enjoyable night. It had been quickly written, recorded and mixed without sleep before the band went on tour in Australia.\nThe song\'s complex arrangement includes a number of instruments and methods not normally used by New Order. For example, a bridge features frogs croaking melodically. The band reportedly included them because Morris loved the effect and was looking for any excuse to use it. At the end of the track, the faint bleating of a (synthesized) sheep can be heard. Sheep samples would reappear in later New Order singles "Fine Time" and "Ruined in a Day".\nDespite being a fan favourite, the song was not performed live between 1993 and 2006 due to the complexity of converting the programs from the E-mu Emulator to the new Roland synthesizer. However, it returned to the live set at a performance in Athens on 3 June 2006.\n\n\n== Sleeve ==\nThe Peter Saville sleeve is uniform silver with the word "perfect" embossed on the front side and "kiss The" on the back, like a wraparound band. It was about this time that the photographer Geoff Power [see "Shellshock"] was introduced to Peter Saville. So enamoured was Peter by Geoff\'s work that he originally offered the photographer the cover to Low-Life. Then when that fell through, they worked on a cover for "The Perfect Kiss" using one of Geoff\'s photographs, which can be seen later in New Order\'s songbook, \'X\'. With time running out and Peter\'s decision not to run with this image - it didn\'t fit in Peter\'s subsequent portraits of the band on Low-Life - Geoff was offered an OMD album cover instead. Geoff decided to use the image for the New Order release, Shellshock, a year later.\n\n\n== Versions ==\nLasting nearly 9 minutes, the full 12" single version of the song is longer than even "Blue Monday", New Order\'s 1983 dance epic. This version also appears on the vinyl edition of Substance, with the CD pressings deleting 44 seconds of the climactic finale, due to time limitations of the CD format in 1987 (future remasterings of Substance did not restore the missing 44 seconds, even though newer CDs would allow for it). The full version was eventually released unedited on the 2-disc deluxe edition of Low-Life, marking its first appearance on CD.\nThe version on the original Low-Life and all post-Substance compilations is a 4:48 edit that omits the third verse (the one that mentions the song\'s title) and fades out before the climax. This version is present on the A-side of the 7" single from the Philippines; most 7" issues from other countries have on the A-side a version that is further edited to 4:24 (in some or all cases without the percussion introduction). The UK 7" promo release on Factory Records is a rarely heard edit cut by Ivan Ivan which compresses most of the elements of the full, 8:46 version (including the ending but not the third verse) into 3:50.\nThere is also a pre-edited recording of the live performance filmed for the music video with later overdubbed mistakes left intact; it is available on the bonus disc included with some editions of Retro and on various promotional vinyl releases.\nThe song has been remixed by third parties like Razormaid and Hot Tracks and has been covered by bands including Capsule Giants, Nude, International, Paradoxx, Razed in a New Division of Agony, and Amoeba Crunch.\n\n\n== B-sides ==\n"The Kiss of Death" is a typical New Order dub version: it is a mostly instrumental remix of the A-side with added effects; it notably features the opening of the album version. "Perfect Pit" is a short recording of synthesized bass and drum parts that sounds like Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris practicing.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nJonathan Demme directed "The Perfect Kiss" video, which is unlike any other New Order clip. Set in the band\'s practice room, it simply depicts the band playing the song from beginning to end. According to Factory Records owner Tony Wilson, Demme was looking forward to filming dynamic shots of Stephen Morris behind the drum kit and was dismayed to find that the drums in the song were all programmed.\nThe video prominently features a Joy Division poster for \'Unknown Pleasures\'.\nThe video appeared on the Substance 1989 VHS tape and the DVD A Collection. An edit of the video version appeared on a US 12" single in 1985. The full audio take, including Demme\'s remarks before and after the performance, appeared on a bonus CD included with early copies of the box set Retro. Since it is a unique live performance, the video version of the song sounds different from other released versions.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks written by Gillian Gilbert, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris and Bernard Sumner.\n\n\n== Chart positions ==\n\n\n== Notes and references ==', 'Karl Adolph Hansen (1851 in Hamburg – 1920 in Giessen) was a German botanist. He graduated in 1887 at the University of Würzburg on a thesis entitled "Geschichte der Assimilation und Chlorophyllfunktion" (supervised by Julius Sachs). He was professor of botany at the Justus Liebig-Universität Gießen 1891-1920. He had very broad academic interests, including history and archaeology. However, he always worked alone, supervised very few doctoral students (4 in 39 years), and stood outside the development of experimental physiological botany among his contemporaries. Hansen wrote scholarly works on Goethe\'s Metamorphosis of Plants and had a fierce dispute over this hypothesis with Houston Stewart Chamberlain.\n\n\n== The wind controversy with Eugenius Warming ==\nIn 1901, Hansen wrote a treatise of the dune vegetation of the East Frisian Islands, in which he proposed salt as the main plant-distributing factor. He thereby neglected previous work by Warming and Raunkiær contending the importance of the wind. Eugenius Warming strongly criticised Hansen\'s work and Hansen returned by criticising Warming\'s Lehrbuch der ökologischen Pflanzengeographie, to which Warming gave another polemic reply.\n\n\n== Selected scientific works ==\nHansen, Ad.

It was burned in 1142, and refounded by the O'Mores. There was a monastic community here as late as 1650.\nThe present fragmentary church has an inserted 15th century chancel arch – now blocked up – leading to the site of the altar.\nThe Round Tower was built in the mid 12th century and is one of the finest in Ireland. Standing 30m high, it is located near the centre of the village. The cap was rebuilt in the 19th century, but the tower is otherwise in its original condition. Its doorway, which is high off the ground and faced the doorway of the church, is elaborately decorated in the Romanesque style. It has four orders (rows of decoration receding into the doorway) two inside and two outside (see photo), separated by a narrow vaulted lobby. The capitals – the heads of the pillars of the doorway – are carved with human heads with intertwining hair.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of the area in 2002 was 517 people, a 2.6% increase since 1996.

He graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a degree in mechanical engineering and worked in varying jobs prior to getting into open poker games in California. He is a former roommate of fellow professional poker player Antonio Esfandiari. Prior to moving to the west, Laak lived for several years in New York City where he honed his skills as a backgammon player before turning his focus to poker.\n\n\n== Poker career ==\nLaak learned to play poker as a child. His first major tournament victory was at the World Poker Tour (WPT) Celebrity Invitational in February 2004. He has made two other WPT final tables since his victory: sixth place in both the season two Battle of Champions and the 2005 Five Diamond World Poker Classic.\nAt the 2005 World Series of Poker (WSOP), Laak finished second to Johnny Chan in the $2,500 pot limit hold \'em event. Laak defeated Ram Vaswani to win the inaugural William Hill Poker Grand Prix, taking home the £150,000 first prize. He has also competed in numerous Poker Royale series. Laak appeared on seasons two through seven of High Stakes Poker on GSN, and served as the dealer on the short-lived television series E! Hollywood Hold\'em.\nLaak was a winner of NBC\'s Poker After Dark, earning the weekly prize of $120,000. The tournament was entitled "Phil Phil" because both Phil Laak and Phil Hellmuth were contenders. Apart from Laak and Hellmuth the table consisted of Doyle Brunson, Antonio Esfandiari, Jennifer Harman, and Erik Seidel. He again won $120,000 in the Nicknames episode, defeating Annette Obrestad, Mike Matusow, Antonio Esfandiari, Erick Lindgren and Phil Hellmuth.\nAt the 2007 conference of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Vancouver, British Columbia, Laak and fellow professional player Ali Eslami competed against, and beat, Polaris, a poker playing computer program developed at the University of Alberta, in two of the four rounds with the remaining rounds being a loss and a draw.\nIn 2008, Laak made a cameo appearance in the Knight Rider television movie, where he was credited as "Poker Pro".\nLaak has written a monthly column called "Being Phil Laak", in the poker-themed Bluff Magazine, since late 2005. Laak co-hosted a show called I Bet You on the (MOJO network) with his friend Antonio Esfandiari where they can be found betting on any and all things.\nLaak also played in the 2009 Aussie Millions cash game Invitational.\nIn October 2009, Laak was crowned PartyPoker.com World Open V champion winning $250,000 in the process. He overcame a final table that included Luke \'FullFlush\' Schwartz and Laak\'s long-term partner - actress and poker pro Jennifer Tilly.\nIn early January 2010, Laak launched his own online poker site, Unabomber Poker. The site, which features cartoon style graphics, is a member of the Cake Poker Network.\nOn September 16, 2010, Laak won his first career WSOP bracelet by winning the ₤2,500 buy-in Six-Handed No-Limit Hold’em championship at the 2010 World Series of Poker Europe. His win came after an accident involving an all-terrain vehicle in August, where he suffered a broken elbow amongst other injuries.\nAn "E" following a year denotes bracelet(s) won at the World Series of Poker Europe\nAs of 2014, his total live tournament winnings exceed $3,100,000.\nOn April 12, 2012, Laak plays live at The Big Game and mucks a €63,750 winning hand on TV setting a record as the biggest televised poker blunder in history. Amazingly, Laak successfully ends the same poker session as the biggest winner at the table.\n\n\n== Nickname and personality ==\n\nLaak became known widely in the poker scene as the "Unabomber" because of the hooded sweatshirt  and sunglasses he wears at the table, making him resemble the forensic sketch of Theodore Kaczynski who was known as the Unabomber. These items were given to him by fellow poker player Gus Hansen. Laak is also known for his unusual and inventive manner of speech. He coined the poker terms "felted" to mean having lost all of one\'s chips (i.e. nothing left in front of the player except the table felt) as well as upstuck, meaning being down from your high point of the session (i.e. if you won $15 000 and then lost $10 000). He also coined the terms POW (Pay off wizard) which he uses in a self-mocking fashion (i.e. one who pays off big bets on the river) and "Cherry bomb" which refers to large, ultimately unsuccessful bets. \nHe is currently dating actress Jennifer Tilly, who won a WSOP bracelet in 2005 in the $1,000 buy-in Ladies no limit Texas hold \'em championship.\nPhil Laak played the first day of the Main Event of the 2008 World Series of Poker incognito, in a latex mask, wig, make-up and costume. His disguise was reported thereafter by AP reporter Oskar Garcia. The WSOP 2009 rules added a new rule prohibiting wearing masks at the table.\nOn June 2–7, 2010, at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, Laak set the world record in longest time spent playing poker in a single session. He halted at 115 hours. The previous official record, 72 hours and 2 minutes, was held by Larry Olmsted, set at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in 2004. Guinness allows one 5-minute break every hour, in which Laak could do whatever he wanted, and Laak could "bank" those 5-minute breaks into longer breaks if he played through. Laak banked several breaks to take a 30-minute nap (allowed), but he vows that he did not use caffeine or any stimulants. Playing $10/$20 No Limit Hold\'em (with uncapped buyins), Laak finished up $6,766 and donated half of his winnings to charity. He did this for Camp Sunshine, a charity that helps sick children enjoy summer camp. His feat was witnessed live on streaming video by over 130,000 people.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorld Poker Tour profile\nInsidePoker magazine interview\nPhil Laak Biography', 'Cynthia Enid Olavarría Rivera (born in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a Puerto Rican actress, fashion model, TV host and beauty pageant titleholder who won Miss Puerto Rico Universe 2005 and placed 1st runner-up at Miss Universe 2005.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nBorn in the Santurce district of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Olavarría was an expressive and eloquent child.

Her best known works include a bronze sculpture of actress Mary Tyler Moore tossing her Tam o\' shanter hat into the air as a homage to the final scene of opening credits of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Gillen life-size sculpture of Moore, which dedicated in 2002 in the Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis, has own of the city\'s most recognizable landmarks and "symbol of Minneapolis". Her other well known pieces include a 4-foot bronze sculpture of Gertie the Duck, which was installed on the Wisconsin Avenue bridge in Milwaukee in 1997.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early and personal life ===\nGillen was born Gwendolyn Scrivener on January 6, 1941. Her father, Carl H. Scrivener, was a newspaper editor for The Patriot Ledger. She was raised in Quincy, Massachusetts. Gillen studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, which helped her lose her Massachusetts accent. She met her future husband, Ronald W. Gillen, who was from Brooklyn at an evening party in New York City. The couple married in a ceremony held on May 20, 1961, in Spokane, Washington. Ronald Gillen was a member of the U.S. Air Force, causing the couple to move frequently, including to Guam and Japan.\nBy the late 1960s, the Gillens had settled in the Milwaukee metropolitan area so Ronald Gillen could enroll at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. They settled in nearby Hustisford, Wisconsin, where they raised two children, Alessandra and Christopher. Gwen Gillen worked as a set designer for a local Wisconsin theater.\n\n\n=== Career ===\nGwen Gillen began her career as a sculptor by creating small, test sculptures in the basement studio of her home in Hustisford, Wisconsin.\nIn 2001, Gillen, by then an accomplished sculptor, was commissioned to create and cast a statue of Mary Tyler Moore\'s iconic cap tossing scene from the opening of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which was set in a fictional television station in Minneapolis. Gillen was chosen from a group of 21 sculptors who had submitted designs for Moore\'s statue. Gillen was elated to be chosen to create Moore\'s likeness in bronze, telling the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2001, "It\'s so enjoyable, really, to be portraying a woman...Sculptors are very seldom called upon to depict a woman of prominence. This is all very refreshing." However, the logistics of creating the Moore\'s trademark hat throw proved to be a challenge for Gillen to replicate. Gillen had to re-create the cap tossing to figure out how best to depict the hat, noting, "I actually practiced throwing the hat to find out when it left the hand...It comes out between 75 and 80 degrees on the slant. So I’m showing it at just between 78 and 80 degrees, with the hat just touching the fingers of her extended right hand, and the thumb open...I\'m not trying to do anything tricky or silly — suspending wires or attaching it to a building or pole. I thought this would be a good way to achieve the effect."\nGillen\'s statue was dedicated at the Nicollet Mall, a pedestrian walkway in downtown Minneapolis, in 2002 with Moore in attendance. According to Gillen\'s daughter, the Mary Tyler Moore statue remained her favorite piece from her portfolio. The statue on display at the Minneapolis Visitor Center, as of February 2017, pending completion of renovations on the Nicollet Mall.\nThough best known for her Mary Tyler Moore bronze, public art by Gillen can be found on display throughout the world. Another of her known is a four-foot tall sculpture of Gertie the Duck and her ducklings, which was installed on the Wisconsin Avenue bridge in Milwaukee in 1997.\nGillen also created several life-size sculptures of Father Joseph Kentenich, founder of the Roman Catholic Schoenstatt Movement, which outside Schoenstatt chapels in Puerto Rico, Rome and Pewaukee, Wisconsin.\nOther examples of Gillen\'s work include war memorials. Gillen designed the Wisconsin Korean War Veterans Memorial in Plover, Wisconsin, which includes five figures, including nurses and infantrymen from the U.S. Army and the United States Marines. However, she deliberately decided not to depict any of the figures carrying weapons in the memorial.\nIn 2005, Gillen was commissioned to create a memorial bust of Michelle Witmer, a member of the Wisconsin National Guard killed in the Iraq War, which now stands at the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs in Madison, Wisconsin. Witmer was the first woman to be killed in combat in the history of the National Guard and the first member of the Wisconsin National Guard to die in combat since World War II. Gillen originally intended to depict a serious face on Witmer\'s sculpture, as usually shown on a fallen soldier, until she met Witmer\'s family, who said she was typically smiling. In a 2005 interview with NPR, Gillen explained her decision to redesign Witmer\'s memorial, "You figure there\'s so many military sculptures out there, and they all have the sort of same feeling to them as far as being honorable, country, duty, serious,” she said. “I mean, it’s not a light subject, but you don’t see many of them smiling. And it\'s not made up something – it\'s not something – \'Well, I want to put a smile on her.\' She constantly had a smile on her. You\'ve got young people that are dying in this war, and young people don’t go around with these serious expressions on their face."\nAnother of Gillen\'s less serious pieces, a 16-foot medallion-shaped, ceramic tile floor mosaic depicting a Holstein cow eating a cream puff, was installed at the southwest entrance to the Wisconsin State Fair in 2000. Her mosaic, funded by the state Percent for Art program, which required that the Fair spend a certain percentage on public art, cost approximately $18,000 dollars. Gillen was an advocate for the Percent for Art program and believed it should be expanded.<ref name=jsonline3>By 2014, millions of visitors, as well harsh Wisconsin winters, had caused the mosaic to crack and crumble, necessitating makeshift concrete patches. Restoration work was needed to restore Gillen\'s bovine-cream puff tile mosaic, though she was suffering from deteriorating health at the time and could not make the repairs herself.\nAn enthusiastic anglophile, Gwen Gillen was a frequent guest of Anthony Hopkins and his former wife, Jenni, at their home in London. She created a bronze bust of Hopkins, which is now on display at a London theatre.\n\n\n=== Later life ===\nGillen resided at the Madison Heights Senior Community in Madison, Wisconsin, from 2013 until her death in January 2017. She died from complications of dementia at the Madison Heights Senior Community hospice unit on January 27, 2017, at the age of 76. She was survived by her older sister, Carol Chapman, and her daughter, Alessandra Gillen. Gillen was predeceased by her husband, Ronald, who died in 2012, and their son, Christopher Gillen, who died in 2015.\nGillen\'s death occurred just two days after the death of Mary Tyler Moore, the subject of Gillen\'s best known sculpture, who died in Connecticut on January 25, 2017. As news of Mary Tyler Moore\'s death broke, more than 150 people gathered near Gillen\'s statue in Minneapolis and tossed their hats in the air in tribute to the actress and The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\n\n\n== References ==', 'The 2007 Ukrainian Super Cup became the fourth edition of Ukrainian Super Cup, an annual football match contested by the winners of the previous season\'s Ukrainian Top League and Ukrainian Cup competitions.

Defenestration is credited in the book Road to Nirvana as one of the bands that influenced Kurt Cobain\'s music and Billy Corgan often credited Chainsaw Kittens as one of his favorite bands—Corgan even once wrote Meade when he was working the first Smashing Pumpkins album lauding the brilliance of Chainsaw Kittens first album, Violent Religion.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMeade was born in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, the youngest of five children. Before settling into retirement, his father worked as an architect, and his mother pursued a career as a nurse. Both parents, according to Meade, instilled in their son the values of treating others with respect, as well as frugality. Meade\'s childhood was filled by music: “[Music] was the only thing I was into" says Meade, "It consumed me." His sister Connie—16 when he was born in 1962—would yank him out of the crib when the Beatles came on the radio. His mom would do the same with groups like the Supremes. "She really loved \'Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart,\'" says Meade. His first two rock shows were Elvis at the Tulsa Assembly Center in 1972 and a night with Alice Cooper\'s harrowing Welcome to My Nightmare tour in 1975 . Meade\'s musical interest eventually gravitated to musicians like New York Dolls, David Bowie, T-Rex (band), and Patti Smith. According to Meade, music was the only place where he could find people who thought and dressed like him.\nIn 1980, the summer Meade graduated from high school, he and fellow music lover, Todd Walker, hung out and wrote songs. According to Meade, "We were all listening to the same stuff—punk, new wave, and fringe bands like Bowie, early Who and T-Rex. My brother Gentry sold me a Gibson Marauder. My cousin Duane showed me three chords, and said I could learn from there. One of the skaters [Meade hung out with] was Todd Walker, who started writing songs with me." Meade was also fed up with 1980s corporate rock. Defenestration was formed.\n\n\n== Defenestration ==\nDefenestration eventually moved to Norman, Oklahoma, where the band recorded its 1984\'s self-titled record. The relative success of that debut led to a deal with the record company Relativity Records and the release of 1987\'s Dali Does Windows. Produced by Randy Burns (Megadeth, The Flaming Lips), Dali Does Windows was reviewed as "a straightforward rock album, albeit one with the staunchly idiosyncratic Tyson Meade at its heart."\nEventually, artistic differences created a power struggle between Meade and Walker. The result was Walker being asked to leave the band and Defenestration falling apart: “Todd Walker and I had the usual power struggle, and the other guys and I kicked him out,” Meade says. “When we got another guitarist, things were just awful. We started working at an algae farm because we were so broke. It was basically slave labor with 12-hour workdays at $5.00 an hour no overtime. I started to have a breakdown.” Though he dove headfirst into to writing songs, it became apparent to Meade that the new incarnation of Defenestration was lacking something. Frustrated and demoralized, Meade packed it in and returned to Norman, where he took a job at indie shop Shadowplay Records. Defenestration was no more.\n\n\n== Chainsaw Kittens ==\nWhile working at Shadowplay Records, Meade met Trent Bell, “a regular customer and loiterer,” and eventual lead guitarist to Chainsaw Kittens, who also won a Grammy as a producer in 2012. Bell informed Meade about a group of high schoolers that had a band and were about to kick out their singer. Bell suggested that Meade\'s songs would be perfect for the band. Meade recalled, "I thought it was ridiculous, but I didn\'t have any other options I could think of, so I decided to play the kids my songs." After holding practice session for a month in 1989, Chainsaw Kittens were born, their name a nod to their trashy punk guitar sound and baby faces. [id] Along with the other founding members—guitarist Mark Metzger, bass guitarist Kevin McElhaney, and drummer Ted Leader—Chainsaw Kittens recorded a demo and received a contract offer almost immediately from Mammoth Records. Whereas in Defenestration it was all tempered with a vaguely mainstream rock sensibility, Todd Walker\'s main contribution to the band—the Chainsaw Kittens dove enthusiastically off the deep end, into the extreme waters of glam-pop-punk, full-on transvestitism, and openly gay lyrics. And while it had a lot do with creative statement, it was also the work of Meade\'s increased understanding of his chosen industry: “I had a definite [idea] of what I wanted the Kittens to be," Meade says. "I wanted to have a band that was signed and made records. A month [after getting together], we made our first demo, and a month after that we were in negotiations with Mammoth Records.”\nThe band\'s inaugural album, Violent Religion, introduced Chainsaw Kittens\' knack for creating fragile melodies and catchy pop choruses alongside twisted lyrics and powerful, raw guitars. The last track on Violent Religion, "She\'s Gone Mad," was covered by fellow-Norman based alt-rockers, The Flaming Lips on their album The Day They Shot a Hole in the Jesus Egg. Before touring in support of their debut, guitarist Trent Bell joined Chainsaw Kittens. While on the road, the band witnessed two additional changes to the lineup; Aaron Preston took over drumming duties, while Clint McBay replaced McElhaney on bass. With the new lineup, featuring Meade, Metzger, McBay, Preston, and Bell, the band recorded their sophomore effort, Flipped Out in Singapore, for which they employed the services of Nirvana\'s Nevermind producer, Butch Vig. Released on Mammoth Records in 1992, the album, containing the songs "Connie I’ve Found the Door" and "High in High School," enabled the group\'s profile and fan base to grow. Another song from Flipped Out in Singapore, "She Gets", is featured on the soundtrack to William Friedkin\'s 2006 movie, Bug starring Ashley Judd. Eventually, Clint McBay and Aaron Preston left the band, both landing on the lineup of straight-and-narrow alt-rockers For Love Not Lisa, who scored a song on the 1994 soundtrack for The Crow.\nMeade installed Kittens-obsessed Chicagoan Matt Johnson on bass and Eric Harmon on drums, promoted Trent Bell to lead guitarist, and the Kittens set to work on their third album, Pop Heiress, with A-list producer John Agnello. Eventually because of strained relationship between Mammoth Records and Atlantic Records, Mammoth cut Chainsaw Kittens loose. Because the Smashing Pumpkins and Chainsaw Kittens had shared producers and toured together in the early 1990s, members of both bands had become friends. So when James Iha and D\'arcy Wretzky of Smashing Pumpkins started their own independent label Scratchie Records, the available Chainsaw Kittens were the perfect place to start. In 1996, the Chainsaw Kittens released their self-titled album, Chainsaw Kittens, under Scratchie Records. Later, the band released a fifth full-length album, The All American, on Four Alarm Records. Despite limited exposure, The All American too received critical praise. Since 2001, Chainsaw Kittens have been on indefinite hiatus. The band reunited for a performance at the Norman Music Festival in Norman, Oklahoma on April 26, 2008.\n\n\n== Solo Career and Life After the Kittens ==\nMeade has produced two full-length solo albums: Motorcycle Childhood and Kitchens and Bathrooms. He also recently collaborated with Derek Brown of The Flaming Lips and Jesse Tabish of Other Lives on a project called "Winter Boys."\n\nMeade resided in Shanghai, the Peoples Republic of China, where he teaches English. Although Meade still adores the aura of glam rock and looks back fondly on his days with Defenestration and Chainsaw Kittens, he admitted burning out as a performer. When he put aside his rock persona and shifted into more of a storyteller with a guitar, he said he fell in love with being onstage again. To this end, Meade now returns to America annually and treats his fans to the occasional concert at Chouse in Norman. He now lives back in Norman. Meade is currently set to work on a third solo album, wherein Meade will record at high schools and universities in China with students. Meade describes the project: “In many ways this is diplomatic and, at the very least, a cultural exchange; in some small way. I would like people to know that Chinese people are awesome. This has become very important to me because when I talk about my love for the Chinese people I sometimes get the most heartbreaking responses from people who just do not know how much the Chinese LOVE us! I was in Shanghai and other areas of China for five years and the one thing that I learned is that the Chinese LOVE America and Americans!”\nAsked about being called a godfather of alternative rock music, Meade had this to say:\n\nI hate to try to credit myself for something that I may or may not have created. At the time, I was fed up with everything going on in music. If you were alive in the 80s you know to what music and bands I am referring. The music that was happening was in no way speaking to me. Furthermore, life in general seemed so restricted. When I started writing music, I was not satisfied with the two choices that were given to me as an 18-year-old. The first choice was go to college in order to work your life away at an office. The other choice was to be a townie and work at a machine shop or restaurant in my hometown. I wanted something different that did not entail a new couch, a new car, a new dining room set. Fortunately, I met a like-minded soul in my hometown and we innocently and haphazardly went about putting together a band. This whole process was a head banging one; that is, a banging my head against the wall one. I soon learned, no clubs would book a band that played original songs. Clubs only booked cover bands at that time in the early and mid-80s. So, we played house parties and VFW halls. If we made 20 bucks we were happy, not 20 bucks apiece but altogether. There were a few other bands that were not hardcore punk doing the same thing but not very many. And, I wrote songs about my life and my inner-struggles and all of that sort of stuff that you have going on when you are in your late teens and early 20s. We rammed 50s guitar licks into 60s power pop colliding into 70s glam and punk and more glam and then pureed it in a blender and we had our sound. Soon after, a hoard of other bands did the same and called it grunge or alternative rock. It then became a big business. I never made any money; I have been paid in fan letters, which is really what I set out to do. I set out to make some sort of change. And I feel as if I did. So, I guess I am one of the alterna-Forefathers. I am a starving alterna-Forefather.\n\n\n== Solo discography ==\nMotorcycle Childhood (Echostatic/Spacebaby, 1995)\nKitchens & Bathrooms (Self Released, 2008)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTyson Meade Home Page, 2008\nTyson Meade Is a Rock God, 2002\nBabysue Interview, 1997\nOasis Interview, 1996\nInterview with Dolly Parton, 2001\nInterview with John Paul Jones, 2001\nCollection of Chainsaw Kittens Music and Videos, 2012\nPerforming with Arbor Day, 2006\nPerforming "Soldier on My Shoulder" 2010\nPerforming "She\'s Gone Mad" 2010', "The structure function (also known as the proton structure function), like the fragmentation function, is a probability density function. It is somewhat analogous to the structure factor in solid-state physics, and the form factor (quantum field theory).\nThe nucleon (proton and neutron) electromagnetic form factors describe the spatial distributions of electric charge and current inside the nucleon and thus are intimately related to its internal structure; these form factors are among the most basic observables of the nucleon. (Nucleons are the building blocks of almost all ordinary matter in the universe. The challenge of understanding the nucleon's structure and dynamics has occupied a central place in nuclear physics.)\nThe structure functions are important in the study of deep inelastic scattering.  \nThe fundamental understanding of structure functions in terms of QCD is one of the outstanding problems in hadron physics. Why do quarks form colourless hadrons with only two stable configurations, proton and neutron? One important step towards answering this question is to characterize the internal structure of the nucleon. High energy electron scattering provides one of the most powerful tools to investigate this structure.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFragmentation function\nStructure factor\nPhoton structure function\n\n\n== References ==", "The Triangle J Council of Governments is one of the 17 regional North Carolina Councils of Governments (Region J) established by the North Carolina General Assembly for the purpose of regional planning and administration.

The first such law took effect in 1844, when the Provisional Government of Oregon voted to exclude all black settlers from Oregon\'s borders. The law authorized a punishment for any black settler remaining in the territory to be whipped with "not less than twenty nor more than thirty-nine stripes" for every six months they remained. Additional laws aimed at African Americans entering Oregon were ratified in 1849 and 1857. The last of these laws was repealed in 1926. The laws, born of anti-slavery and anti-black beliefs, were often justified as a reaction to fears of blacks instigating Native American uprisings.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\nEarly white settlers in Oregon often held both anti-slavery and anti-black beliefs, and many came from states, such as Missouri, which had some version of exclusion laws. White settlers believed banning slavery would eliminate political controversy, but feared that settlements of freed slaves would compete for power with whites. One early migrant wrote that Oregon pioneers "hated slavery, but a much larger number of them hated free negroes worse even than slaves.”\nIn 1843, the Provisional Government of Oregon established a set of organic laws, including a ban on slavery: "There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." Enforcement of the law was left unclear. After a vote on June 26, 1844, the first Black Exclusion law reiterated a ban on all slavery in Oregon territory, while also forcing blacks and mulatto settlers to leave Oregon territory within three years (two years for men), or else to be whipped "no more than 39 times." This section was amended in December 1844 to permit a free slave to be resold on the condition that the slave owner agree to remove them from the territory at the end of the contract, which was held with the provisional government. In effect, this re-established slavery on a temporary basis for three years. The law was repealed in 1845, having never been invoked.\nOn September 21, 1849, the US territory established its second exclusion law, declaring a ban on "any negro or mulatto to enter into, or reside" in Oregon unless already established there. At least four blacks were punished under this law, including Jacob Vanderpool, a sailor, and three others who were eventually permitted to stay.\nAn 1850 census showed fewer than 50 black residents in the state of Oregon, including a mixed-race man from Pennsylvania, George Washington Bush, who was forced to move North of the Columbia River after the first exclusion Law was passed. George Washington, another unrelated free man, was the founder of Centralia, Washington.\nOn April 16, 1852, Robin Holmes, a black slave of Nathaniel Ford, brought a case to the territorial Supreme Court, charging that he and his family were being held by Ford illegally. Holmes v. Ford was heard by four judges, culminating in Judge George H. Williams\' June 1853 ruling that slavery was illegal in Oregon. Descendants of Holmes have since stated that Ford had encouraged the lawsuit as a means to bring an end to slavery in the state.\nOn November 7, 1857, Oregon\'s delegates to the state Constitutional Convention submitted proposals to legalize slavery and to ban blacks from the state, including a ban on signing contracts or owning land. The slavery amendment failed, but the exclusion law passed. Oregon was the only state admitted to the Union with such an exclusion law. There are no records that this law was enforced, and the legislature voted down a proposed 1865 law that would authorize sheriffs to deport black residents in their counties.\n\n\n== 1844 law and amendments ==\n\nThe Cockstock Incident was a major factor in the passage of the first black exclusion law. It centered on a fight between a Wasco Native American man, Cockstock, and a free black man, James D. Saules, over ownership of a horse. The argument escalated into a melee that killed three men, and led to rhetoric among white settlers that African-Americans could create an uprising among local Native American tribes against settlers.\nOn June 24, 1844, within days of the Cockstock Incident, the Oregon Provisional Legislature suspended its rules to allow Peter Burnett to propose a bill "for the prevention of slavery" without reference to a committee. The bill was read twice and voted into law the following day. The bill contained methods of enforcement for the prevention of slavery, which had already been banned in the territory. These laws included a three year limit on all free blacks, and required freed slaves to leave the state within two years, if male, and three years, if female. The initial law proposed "no more than 20" lashings by whip for slaves found in violation of the law, which was amended in December 1844. A week after the law\'s passage, Burnett wrote in a personal letter that the bill was intended to "keep clear of that most troublesome class of population."\nDecades later, Burnett publicly described the Exclusion Law as intended to prevent disenfranchised blacks from being exposed to politically empowered whites, which he wrote "reminds them of their inferiority," and suggested that their presence was "injurious to the dominant class itself, as such a degraded and practically defenseless condition offers so many temptations to tyrannical abuse."\nThe law had an unknown impact on blacks in the state, and no records suggest it was ever enforced.\n\n\n=== Text of 1844 law and amendments ===\nThough the official text of the original law has been lost, it was reprinted in several sources at the time. The law as described contained eight sections, and two amendments were added in December 1844. The Oregon exclusion law prohibited free black men and women in the territory, though jurisdiction for the law was limited to the region south of the Columbia river.\n\n\n==== Section 1 ====\n\nThat slavery and involuntary servitude shall be forever prohibited in Oregon.\n\n\n==== Section 2 ====\n\nThat in all cases where slaves shall have been, or shall hereafter be, brought into Oregon, the owners of such slaves respectively shall have the term of three years from the introduction of such slaves to remove them out of the country.\n\n\n==== Section 3 ====\n\nThat if such owners of slaves shall neglect or refuse to remove such slaves from the country within the time specified in the preceding section, such slaves shall be free.\n\n\n==== Section 4 ====\n\nThat when any free negro or mulatto shall have come to Oregon, he or she (as the case may be), if of the age of eighteen or upward, shall remove from and leave the country within the term of two years for males, and three for females, from the passage of this act, and that if any free negro or mulatto shall hereafter come to Oregon, if of the age aforesaid, he or she shall quite and leave the country within the term of two years for males and three for females, from his or her arrival in the country.\n\n\n==== Section 5 ====\n\nThat if such free negro or mulatto be under the age aforesaid, the terms of time specified in the preceding section shall begin to run when he or she arrive at such age.\n\n\n==== Section 6 ====\n\nThat if such free negro or mulatto shall fail to quit the country, as required by this act, he or she may be arrested upon a warrant issued by some justice of the peace, and, if guilty upon trial before such justice, shall receive upon his or her bare back not less than twenty nor more than thirty-nine stripes, to be inflicted by the constable of the proper country.\n\n\n==== Section 7 ====\n\nThat if any free negro or mulatto shall fail to quit the country within the term of six months after receiving such stripes, he or she shall again receive the same punishment once in every six months, until he or she shall quit the country.\n\n\n==== Section 8 ====\n\nThat when any slave shall obtain his or her freedom, the time specified in the fourth section shall begin to run from the time when such freedom shall be obtained.\n\n\n==== December amendment ====\n\nBe it enacted by the Legislative Committee of Oregon as follows:\n\nSection 1: That the sixth and seventh sections of said act are hereby repealed.\n\nSection 2: That if any such free negro or mulatto shall fail to quit and leave the country, as required by the act to which this is amendatory, he or she may be arrested upon a warrant issued by some justice of the peace, and if guilty upon trial before such justice ... the said justice shall issue his order to any officer competent to execute process, directing said officer to give ten days\' public notice, by at least four written or printed advertisements, that he will publicly hire out such free negro or mulatto from the country for the shortest term of service, shall enter into a bond with good and sufficient security to Oregon, in a penalty of at least one thousand dollars, binding himself to remove said negro or mulatto out of the country within six months after such service shall expire,; which bond shall be filed in the clerk\'s office in the proper county, and upon failure to perform the conditions of said bond, the attourney prosecuting for Oregon shall commence a suit upon a certified copy of such bond in the circuit court against such delinquent and his sureties.\n\n\n== 1849 law ==\nIn September 1849, the legislature passed another exclusion law, with a preamble arguing that "it would be highly dangerous to allow free negroes and mulattos to reside in the Territory or to intermix with the Indians, instilling in their minds feelings of hostility against the white race." The 1849 law ordered any blacks entering the territory to leave within 40 days. It was applied in 1851 to Jacob Vanderpool, a West Indian who had migrated to Oregon City. A white resident of the city brought a case against Vanderpool, who was arrested and ordered to leave Oregon within 30 days. Subsequent complaints against the family of Abner Hunt Francis were ordered out of the state within 40 days, but were allowed to stay after a petition was signed by 225 citizens. The petition formed the basis of a failed coalition to amend the exclusion law to allow for good behavior bonds by black settlers. The Francis family moved to Canada in 1861. A petition was also used in 1854 to prevent the deportation of Morris Thomas and Jane Snowden.\nOregon\'s congressional delegate, Samuel Thurston, while seeking to limit federal land grants to whites, described the law to congress: "The negroes associate with the Indians and intermarry, and, if their free ingress is encouraged or allowed, there would a relationship spring up between them and the different tribes, and a mixed race would ensue inimical to the whites; and the Indians being led on by the negro who is better acquainted with the customs, language, and manners of the whites, than the Indian, these savages would become much more formidable than they otherwise would, and long and bloody wars would be the fruits of the commingling of the races."\nThe law was repealed in 1854.\n\n\n== 1857 law ==\n\nIn 1857, Oregon voters had supported statehood for Oregon and subsequently called for a constitutional convention. The emergent constitution contained 185 sections, 172 of which were copied from various other state constitutions, with the additions primarily racial exclusion or finance related. The document enshrined an Exclusion Law into Section 35 of the Bill of Rights within the Oregon State Constitution. The article read as follows:\n\n"No free negro or mulatto not residing in this state at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall come, reside or be within this state or hold any real estate, or make any contracts, or maintain any suit therein; and the legislative assembly shall provide by penal laws for the removal by public officers of all such negroes and mulattoes, and for their effectual exclusion from the state, and for the punishment of persons who shall bring them into the state, or employ or harbor them."\n\nJohn R. McBride, later a state senator, described the amendment: "It was largely an expression against any mingling of the white with any of the other races, and upon a theory that as we had yet no considerable representation of other races in our midst, we should do nothing to encourage their introduction. We were building a new state on virgin ground; its people believed it should encourage only the best elements to come to us, and discourage others." The question of slavery itself was put to a popular vote, with the public voting against slavery (by a vote of 7727 to 2645) but in favor of racial exclusion policies (by a vote of 8640 to 1081). The final state constitution denied "negroes, mulattos and Chinamen" from voting or owning land.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nFrom 1850 to 1860, Oregon saw its black population increase by just 75, compared to an increase of 4,000 in neighboring California. Oregon\'s black exclusion laws have been linked to a below-average black population – two percent – into the present day. Historian Cheryl Brooks has proposed that Oregon\'s small black population has made it difficult for Oregonians to recognize racial discrimination problems in the state.\n\n\n== References ==', 'The T-84 is a Ukrainian main battle tank (MBT), a development of the Soviet T-80 main battle tank. It was first built in 1994 and entered service in the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 1999. The T-84 is based on the diesel-engined T-80 version, the T-80UD. Its high-performance opposed-piston engine makes it one of the fastest MBTs in the world, with a power-to-weight ratio of about 26 horsepower per tonne (19 kW/t). The T-84 Oplot is an advanced version incorporating an armoured ammunition compartment in a new turret bustle; ten of these entered Ukrainian service in 2001. The T-84-120 Yatagan is a prototype model intended for export, mounting a 120 mm gun capable of firing standard NATO ammunition and guided missiles.\n\n\n== Production history ==\nThe T-84 is the latest Ukrainian development of the T-80 series, designed by KMDB in Kharkiv. A main design objective was to make Ukraine\'s arms industry independent of Russia\'s, after resulting difficulties in fulfilling a contract to supply T-80UD tanks to Pakistan. An external difference from earlier models is the new Ukrainian welded turret, replacing the T-80\'s Russian-built cast turret (some T-80s shipped to Pakistan were fitted with the T-84 welded turret, but lack other T-84 improvements).\nThe T-84\'s outstanding feature is the 26 hp/t power-to-weight ratio. It has inherited the nickname Flying Tank from the T-80. The tank is also designed to perform well in hot climates, and even includes an air-conditioned crew compartment (operating temperature range is claimed to be −40 °C to 55 °C).\nDue to the collapse of Soviet Union, the Malyshev Factory was no longer able to obtain ceramic armour modules from Russia and only the initial batch of T-84 were produced with such. Instead, later batches of T-84\'s composite armour is composed of special purpose rubber sandwiched between steel and alloy plates. The exact comparison of new and previous armor performance is not known and highly depend on performance of dynamic armor which continuously improved.\nUkraine has demonstrated several upgraded prototypes of this tank, intended for both domestic employment and international sale.\n\n\n=== Models ===\nT-84\nUkrainian Modernization of the T-80UD.

Mounts a 120 mm main gun which fires both NATO 120 mm rounds (like the M829 DU series) and a special 120 mm version of the AT-11 Sniper ATGM. It also has automated gear shifting in place of mechanical gear selector, driver\'s T-bar control replacing tiller bars, air conditioning, and projectile muzzle velocity sensor, as well as differences in the fire control system, communications, etc.\nT-84 Oplot-M\n\n(Modernized), or "BM Oplot": The newest and most sophisticated version of the T-84 is an upgraded version of the "T-84 Oplot" mounting more advanced armor, new electronic countermeasure systems, and others. One visible feature is the new PNK-6 panoramic tank sight.\nDesign\nThe BM Oplot is a further development of the previous Oplot, which is based on the T-84 main battle tank. The tank has a conventional layout with the driver\'s compartment at the front, fighting compartment in the middle and engine at the rear, accommodating a crew of three members.\nThe driver sitting in the centre is provided with a single-piece hatch cover that opens to the right. The commander on the right and the gunner on the left have single-piece hatches.\nTank has a length of 9.7 m (including the forward-facing gun), a width of 3.4 m without removable side skirts, and a height of 2.8 m. The combat weight of the tank is 51 tons.\nArmament\nThe Oplot MBT is armed with a 125 mm smoothbore KBA-3 cannon, a KT-7.62 (PKT) Coaxial machine gun and a KT-12.7 anti-aircraft machine gun. The main gun is fed by a loading system equipped with conveyor, automatic loader and control system. The ammunition includes high explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG), armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding-sabot (APFSDS), high explosive anti tank (HEAT) and gun mount (GM) rounds.\nThe main gun can also fire a laser guided missile against battle tanks, armoured vehicles and hovering helicopters within the range of 5,000m. The missile can be fired on the move against travelling targets. The tandem warhead fitted on the missile can defeat targets equipped with explosive reactive armour and advanced spaced armour.\nThe Oplot has 46 rounds of ammunition for the main gun, of which 28 rounds are placed in the automatic loader. Other ammunition types carried are 1,250 rounds for KT-7.62 machine gun, 450 rounds for KT-12.7 machine gun and 450 rounds for AKS submachine gun.\nFire Control\nThe vehicle has three forward-facing periscopes in front of the driver\'s cupola. The centre periscope can be replaced with a night driving device.\nThe fire control system includes a gunner\'s day sight, PNK-6 commander\'s panoramic sighting system, PTT-2 thermal imaging sight, anti-aircraft sight and anti-aircraft machine gun control system. Detection range of targets for thermal sighting system is up to 8 km.\nThe tank is also equipped with LIO-V ballistic computer, armament stabiliser and other systems.\nThe advanced fire-control system enables the gunner or commander to lay and fire the main armament on the move. The stationary and moving targets can be hit with a high first round hit probability.\nProtection\nThe protection system includes multilayer passive armour, Duplet explosive reactive armour, Zaslon active protection system, Varta optronic countermeasures system and other tank protection means.\nBuilt-in new generation Duplet anti-tandem-warhead explosive reactive armour protects against APFSDS, (HESH) or high-explosive plastic (HEP) and HEAT-type projectiles.\nDuplet ensures protection against:\nhand anti-tank grenades, hand-held and stationary grenade launchers and recoilless guns (including ammunition with tandem warheads)\nanti-tank missiles of TOW-2, MILAN and Shturm-S type\nHEAT projectiles fired by 125 mm tank smoothbore guns\nAPFSDS projectiles fire by 125 mm and 120 mm tank guns\nBoth sides of the driver\'s compartment are fitted with explosive reactive armour panels for extended protection. The hull sides are hinged with large rubber skirts to withstand the attacks of man-portable anti-tank weapons. The modular explosive reactive armour package can be easily replaced or upgraded according to the future requirements.\nOplot features a Varta optronic countermeasures system for deceiving incoming missiles and anti-tank guided weapons. The system integrates laser warning sensors, infra-red jammer and smoke / aerosol screen laying system. The optronic countermeasure system provides:\nconfusing of the guidance systems of ATGM by putting out laser jamming covering the horizontal plane of ±18° relative to the main gun tube and ±2° in the vertical plane\njamming of the ATGM guidance systems that use laser illumination of targets, semi-automatic laser guided homing projectiles as well as artillery systems equipped with laser range-finders by activating the remote fast-deploying aerosol screens in a sector of ±45° relative to the main gun tube\nCrew\'s collective protection system ensures protection of the crew and interior equipment against effects of nuclear explosions, radioactive substances, toxic agents and biological warfare agents, as well as detection and suppression of fires in the crew compartment and power pack compartment.\nThe Oplot tank can withstand an explosion of up to 10 kg trinitrotoluene (TNT) under the tank track and up to 4 kg TNT under the driver\'s compartment. The vehicle has overpressure-type NBC protection system and can be fitted with track mine-clearing systems.\nMobility\nBM Oplot is powered by a 6TD-2E 6-cylinder turbocharged liquid-cooled engine, which delivers 1,200 hp (882 kW). It is improved and more environmentally friendly version of the previous 6TD-2 diesel engine, used on the T-84 MBT. Also tank would be powered by a more powerful 6TD-3 diesel, developing 1,500 hp. Both engines could use diesel, jet engine fuel, petrol or any mixtures of them.\nThe engine provides a maximum on-road speed of 70 km/h and a range of 500 km with additional fuel tanks. The battle tank is also equipped with a diesel-electric auxiliary power unit (10 kW) to supply power to onboard systems when the main engine is turned off.\nBM Oplot is equipped with torsion bar type suspension. Either side of the six dual rubber-tyred road wheels are provided with idler at forward, drive sprocket at the rear, and track support rollers.\nThe first, second and sixth road wheel stations are fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers. The tank can negotiate a gradient of 320 and side slope of 250. Equally, the tank can ford a water depth of 5m using deep water fording equipment.\nT-84 Oplot-T\n"BM Oplot-T" is an export version for Thailand. It has some minor modifications to meet local requirements, such as different radio, air conditioner and so on. Thailand ordered 49 of these main battle tanks. Originally it was planned that all of these MBTs will be delivered by 2014. However due to ongoing military conflict in Ukraine by 2017 only 25 of these tanks were delivered.\n\n\n=== Variants ===\nBREM-84 Atlet – Armoured recovery vehicle based on the T-84 Oplot chassis.\nBREM-T – Armoured recovery vehicle based on the T-84 Oplot-T chassis.\nBMU-84 – Bridgelayer tank.\nBTMP-84 – Heavy infantry fighting vehicle prototype based on the T-84 Oplot tank, with lengthened hull, an extra pair of road wheels, and a rear compartment for five infantrymen.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\n\n\n=== Ukraine ===\nThe first T-84 prototype vehicle rolled out in 1994, and in the same year it was decided to build several more vehicles. They were subjected to extensive company and army trials. After successful completion of the extensive trials programme in the late 1990s the T-84 MBT entered service with the Ukrainian Army in 1999.\n\n\n=== Thailand ===\nIn September 2011, The Malyshev Plant, based in Kharkiv, announced plans to produce the first batch of five Oplot-M tanks for the Thai Army by the end of the year. Under the contract, the Ukrainian company will make 49 tanks worth over USD 200 million.\nAs of June 2017, 25 tanks have been delivered.\n\n\n== List of operators ==\n\n\n=== Current operators ===\n Ukraine\nThe Ukrainian Ground Forces has 10 T-84 Oplot in service.\n Thailand\nThe Royal Thai Army has 36 T-84 Oplot-T in service.\nIn March 2011, the Royal Thai Army placed an order for 49 T-84s to replace its fleet of aging M41A3 Walker Bulldog light tanks. Up to 200 tanks may eventually be acquired. However, the Royal Thai Army had yet to make an official announcement. The government had just approved 7.155 billion baht to purchase the first 49 Oplot tanks to be assigned to several units: the 2nd cavalry battalion (Royal Guard at Fort Chakrabongse, Prachinburi), the 4th cavalry battalion (Royal Guard at Kiakkai, Bangkok), the 8th cavalry battalion (Fort Suranari, Nakhon Ratchasima), and the 9th cavalry battalion (Fort Ekathotsarot, Phitsanuloke). The first T-84 Oplot was to be delivered for testing at Cavalry Center at Fort Adisorn, Saraburi in mid-2013 and during the official procurement. The factory in Ukraine had offered the extra 5 T-84 Oplot in addition to the first 49 Oplot tanks. 10 tanks were delivered by beginning of 2016. 5 tanks were delivered in november 2016. Thus, the number of delivered tanks reached 15 units. However in April 2017 the Bangkok Post revealed that only 10 tanks had been delivered and that the contract had been cancelled as Ukraine could not complete the order. Bangkok Post article from 9 May 2017 stated that the army received 20 Oplot tanks and cited Gen Chalermchai saying the army is expected to receive another five soon and insisting that a full battalion of the Ukrainian tanks would be procured by the army. In April 2017 it was reported that following the delayed deliveries from this tank, the Royal Thai Army had declined the sale and acquired the Chinese VT-4 main battle tank instead of the Ukrainian tank, due to the long term delivery schedule. However, in November 2017 Thailand had received 31 of the T84 Oplot tanks, five tanks were heading to Thailand by ship and the final batch of the remaining 13 tanks were already been manufactured.\n\n\n=== Potential sales ===\n Peru\nIn 2009, Peru reportedly tested the Oplot tank, but the government of Alan Garcia later decided to acquire test examples of the Chinese MBT-2000 in late 2010, only to have the government of his successor, Ollanta Humala, abandon the purchase in early 2012 to seek other alternatives. In May 2013, the T-84 was reported to be part of comparative tests to be conducted by Peru. The T-84 competed against the T-90S, the M1A1 Abrams, the Leopard 2A4 and A6, and the T-64 also offered by Ukraine. By September 2013, only the T-84, T-90S, Russian T-80, and M1A1 Abrams were still competing.\n Pakistan\nUkraine is in talks with Pakistan for the sale of 100 Oplot Tanks.\n\n\n=== Failed bids ===\n Azerbaijan\nIn January 2011, Azerbaijan showed interest in the Oplot main battle tank.

He had been a leading figure in the Melkite Church and metropolitan bishop of Aleppo. He died a few months after his election as Patriarch, probably poisoned because his will to proceed with a union with the Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Metropolitan of Aleppo ==\nAbdel-Karim Karmah was born in 1572 in Hama, Syria, son of a priest. In his twenties he went to Jerusalem where he entered in the monastery of Saint Michel, a cloister associated with Mar Saba Monastery. After two years of prayer, he was asked by his bishop Simeon to return to Hama where he was ordained deacon and later priest. A few years later he moved for service to Aleppo where he got appraisal as preacher.\nOn 12 February 1612 Karmah was consecrated metropolitan bishop of Aleppo by Patriarch Athanasius II Dabbas, and he took the name of the saint of that day, ‘’Meletios’’. One of his aims as metropolitan was to increase the literacy and the education of his flock and his presbyter, which needed liturgical and religious books in Arabic. Thus Karmah in 1612 published in Arabic the Typicon of Mar Saba, a Liturgicon and a Sticherarion, but to go on with further publications he needed money. For this purpose he asked a grant to Rome, and he relied on the Franciscans missionaries for financial support and for teaching. He succeeded also to persuade the Vatican to stat preparing an Arabic translation of the whole Bible, something quite difficult to obtain in the years after the Council of Trent, but the translation took time and only the Gospels were published.\nWhile Karmah was metropolitan of Aleppo, he was attacked many times. The first time was in 1614 and he had to go to Constantinople to defend himself in front of Patriarch Timothy II of Constantinople, who decided to confirm him in his position. Some years later he was strongly attached by the claiming-patriarch Cyril IV Dabbas because he supported the other claiming-patriarch, Ignatius III Atiyah. In 1624 Cyril Dabbas moved to Aleppo but Karmah always refused to concelebrate with him. Karmah went on refusing to recognize Cyrill even at the celebration of Easter 1625. Thus Cyrill Dabbas accused him in front of the Ottoman authorities who arrested and processed him. Karmah was beaten and fined with a large amount of money, which was offered by the Christians of Aleppo to have him released. In 1627 he had again to return to Constantinople to defend himself, also this time successfully. In 1628 he took part to the Synod of Ras-Baalbek where, along with all the other Melkite bishops, deposed Cyrill declaring Ignatius III to be the sole patriarch.\n\n\n== Patriarch ==\nA few months after the bloody death of Patriarch Ignatius III Atiyah, he was elected as new Patriarch by the Christians of Damascus and consecrated on 1 May 1634, taking the name of Euthimios III. Because of his friendly relations with the Western missionaries he had in the previous years, his first decision as Patriarch was to send a delegation to Rome to renew the union with the Catholic Church set forth in the Council of Florence. He also planned to open schools with Jesuits teachers.\nBecause of these openings towards the Catholic Church, he clashed with the pro-Orthodox and pro-Turkish parties into the Melkite Church. In the meantime his delegation arrived to Rome and obtained a positive response from Propaganda Fide, he died in Damascus on 1 January 1635, probably poisoned because his will to proceed with a union with the Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Notes ==', 'Hongcheng Stadium (Simplified Chinese: 弘诚体育场) is a multi-purpose stadium in Qingdao, China.

He was the only son of Sir Ferdinand Dalberg-Acton, 7th Baronet and a grandson of the Neapolitan admiral Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet. From 1837 to 1869 he was known as Sir John Dalberg-Acton, 8th Baronet.\nHe is perhaps best known for the remark in a letter to an Anglican bishop, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men,..."\n\n\n== Early life ==\nActon\'s grandfather, who in 1791 succeeded to the baronetcy and family estates in Shropshire, previously held by the English branch of the Acton family, represented a younger branch which had transferred itself first to France and then to Italy. However, by the extinction of the elder branch, the admiral became head of the family. His eldest son, Richard, married Marie Louise Pelline, the only daughter and heiress of Emmerich Joseph, 1st Duc de Dalberg, a naturalised French noble of ancient German lineage who had entered the French service under Napoleon and represented Louis XVIII at the Congress of Vienna in 1814. After Sir Richard Acton\'s death in 1837, she became the wife of the 2nd Earl Granville (1840). Marie Louise Pelline de Dalberg was heiress of Herrnsheim in Germany. She became the mother of John Dalberg-Acton who was born in Naples.\nFrom an old Roman Catholic family, young Acton was educated at Oscott College under future-Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman until 1848 and then at Edinburgh where he studied privately. His attempt to be admitted to the University of Cambridge failed because he was a Catholic. So Acton went to Munich where he studied at the University and resided in the house of Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger, theologian and forerunner of the Old Catholic Church, with whom he became lifelong friends. Döllinger had inspired in him a deep love of historical research and a profound conception of its functions as a critical instrument, particularly in the history of liberty. He was a master of the principal foreign languages and began at an early age to collect a magnificent historical library, with the object—which, however, he never realised—of writing a great "History of Liberty." In politics, he was always an ardent Liberal.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nThrough extensive travels, Acton spent much time in the chief intellectual centres reading the actual correspondence of historical personalities. Among his friends were Montalembert, Tocqueville, Fustel de Coulanges, Bluntschli, von Sybel and Ranke. In 1855, he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Shropshire. A year later, he was attached to Lord Granville\'s mission to Moscow as British representative at the coronation of Alexander II of Russia.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nIn 1859, Acton settled in England, at his country house, Aldenham, in Shropshire. He was returned to the House of Commons that same year as member for the Irish Borough of Carlow and became a devoted admirer and adherent of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. However, Acton was not an active MP, and his parliamentary career came to an end after the general election of 1865, when he headed the Liberal ballot for Bridgnorth near his Shropshire home. Acton defeated Conservative leader Henry Whitmore, who successfully petitioned for a scrutiny of the ballots, and thus retained his own seat and Acton lost his new seat. After the Reform Act 1867, Acton again contested Bridgnorth, this time reduced to a single seat, in 1868 but to no avail.\nActon took a great interest in the United States, considering its federal structure the perfect guarantor of individual liberties. During the American Civil War, his sympathies lay entirely with the Confederacy, for their defence of States\' Rights against a centralised government that he believed would, by what he thought to be all historical precedent, inevitably turn tyrannical. His notes to Gladstone on the subject helped sway many in the British government to sympathise with the South. After the South\'s surrender, he wrote to Robert E. Lee that "I mourn for the stake which was lost at Richmond more deeply than I rejoice over that which was saved at Waterloo," adding that he "deemed that you were fighting battles for our liberty, our progress, and our civilization."\nIn 1869 Queen Victoria raised Acton to the peerage as Baron Acton, of Aldenham in the County of Shropshire. His elevation came primarily through the intercession of Gladstone. The two were intimate friends and frequent correspondents. Matthew Arnold said that "Gladstone influences all round him but Acton; it is Acton who influences Gladstone." Acton was appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as a Knight Commander (KCVO) in the 1897 Birthday Honours.\n\n\n=== Religion and writings ===\n\nMeanwhile, Acton became the editor of the Roman Catholic monthly paper, The Rambler, in 1859, upon John Henry (later Cardinal) Newman\'s retirement from the editorship. In 1862, he merged this periodical into the Home and Foreign Review. His contributions at once gave evidence of his remarkable wealth of historical knowledge. Though a sincere Roman Catholic, his whole spirit as a historian was hostile to ultramontane pretensions, and his independence of thought and liberalism of view speedily brought him into conflict with the Roman Catholic hierarchy. As early as August 1862, Cardinal Wiseman publicly censured the Review; and when in 1864, after Döllinger\'s appeal at the Munich Congress for a less hostile attitude towards historical criticism, the pope issued a declaration that the opinions of Catholic writers were subject to the authority of the Roman congregations, Acton felt that there was only one way of reconciling his literary conscience with his ecclesiastical loyalty, and he stopped the publication of his monthly periodical. He continued, however, to contribute articles to the North British Review, which, previously a Scottish Free Church organ, had been acquired by friends in sympathy with him, and which for some years (until 1872, when it ceased publication) promoted the interests of a high-class Liberalism in both temporal and ecclesiastical matters. Acton also did a good deal of lecturing on historical subjects.\nIn the March 1862 Rambler, Acton wrote: "The Celts are not among the progressive, initiative races, but among those which supply the materials rather than the impulse of history, and are either stationary or retrogressive. The Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, and the Teutons are the only makers of history, the only authors of advancement. Other races possessing a highly developed language, a speculative religion, enjoying luxury and art, attain to a certain pitch of cultivation which they are unable to either communicate or to increase. They are a negative element in the world." And: "Subjection to a people of a higher capacity for government is of itself no misfortune; and it is to most countries the condition of their political advancement."\nIn 1870, along with his mentor Döllinger, Acton opposed the moves to promulgate the doctrine of papal infallibility in the First Vatican Council, travelling to Rome to lobby against it, ultimately unsuccessfully. Unlike Döllinger Acton did not become an Old Catholic, and continued attending Mass regularly; he received the last rites on his deathbed. The Catholic Church did not try to force his hand. It was in this context that, in a letter he wrote to scholar and ecclesiastic Mandell Creighton, dated April 1887, Acton made his most famous pronouncement:\n\nBut if we might discuss this point until we found that we nearly agreed, and if we do agree thoroughly about the impropriety of Carlylese denunciations and Pharisaism in history, I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men, with a favourable presumption that they did no wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way, against the holders of power, increasing as the power increases. Historic responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority, still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it. That is the point at which the negation of Catholicism and the negation of Liberalism meet and keep high festival, and the end learns to justify the means. You would hang a man of no position like Ravaillac; but if what one hears is true, then Elizabeth asked the gaoler to murder Mary, and William III of England ordered his Scots minister to extirpate a clan. Here are the greatest names coupled with the greatest crimes; you would spare those criminals, for some mysterious reason. I would hang them higher than Haman, for reasons of quite obvious justice, still more, still higher for the sake of historical science.\n\nThenceforth he steered clear of theological polemics. He devoted himself to reading, study and congenial society. With all his capacity for study, he was a man of the world and a man of affairs, not a bookworm. His only notable publications were a masterly essay in the Quarterly Review of January 1878 on "Democracy in Europe;" two lectures delivered at Bridgnorth in 1877 on "The History of Freedom in Antiquity" and "The History of Freedom in Christianity"—these last the only tangible portions put together by him of his long-projected "History of Liberty;" and an essay on modern German historians in the first number of the English Historical Review, which he helped to found (1886). After 1879 he divided his time between London, Cannes, and Tegernsee in Bavaria, enjoying and reciprocating the society of his friends. In 1872 he had been given the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Munich; in 1888 Cambridge gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, and in 1889 Oxford the Doctor of Civil Law; and in 1890 he received the high academic accolade of being made a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.\nIn 1874, when Gladstone published his pamphlet on The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance, Lord Acton wrote during November and December a series of remarkable letters to The Times, illustrating Gladstone\'s main theme by numerous historical examples of papal inconsistency, in a way which must have been bitter enough to the ultramontane party, but ultimately disagreeing with Gladstone\'s conclusion and insisting that the Church itself was better than its premises implied. Acton\'s letters led to another storm in the English Roman Catholic world, but once more it was considered prudent by the Holy See to leave him alone. In spite of his reservations, he regarded "communion with Rome as dearer than life".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1865 Acton married Countess Marie Anna Ludomilla Euphrosina von Arco auf Valley, daughter of the Bavarian Count Maximilian von Arco auf Valley, by whom he had six children:\nHon. Mary Elizabeth Anne Dalberg-Acton (1866–1951), married Lt-Col. Edward Bleiddian Herbert and had issue.\nHon. Annie Mary Catherine Dalberg-Acton (1868–1917)\nRichard Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 2nd Baron Acton (1870–1924)\nHon. John Dalberg Dalberg-Acton (1872–1873)\nHon. Elizabeth Mary Dalberg-Acton (1874–1881)\nHon. Jeanne Marie Dalberg-Acton (1876–1919)\nHis nephew was Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley (1897–1945), a German count and political activist, and assassin of socialist Bavarian minister-president Kurt Eisner in 1919.\n\n\n== Professor at Cambridge ==\nActon\'s reputation for learning gradually spread abroad, largely through Gladstone\'s influence. Gladstone found him a valuable political adviser, and in 1892, when the Liberal government came in, Lord Acton was made a lord-in-waiting. Finally, in 1895, on the death of Sir John Seeley, Lord Rosebery appointed him to the Regius Professorship of Modern History at Cambridge. He delivered two courses of lectures on the French Revolution and on Modern History, but it was in private that the effects of his teaching were felt most. The Cambridge Modern History, though he did not live to see it, was planned under his editorship.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nLord Acton became ill in 1901 and died on 19 June 1902 in Tegernsee. He was succeeded in the title by his son, Richard Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 2nd Baron Acton. His 60,000-volume library, formed for use and not for display and composed largely of books full of his own annotations, was bought immediately after his death by Andrew Carnegie and presented to John Morley, who forthwith gave it to the University of Cambridge.\nAccording to Hugh Chisholm, editor of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica:\n\nLord Acton has left too little completed original work to rank among the great historians; his very learning seems to have stood in his way; he knew too much and his literary conscience was too acute for him to write easily, and his copiousness of information overloads his literary style. But he was one of the most deeply learned men of his time, and he will certainly be remembered for his influence on others.\n\n\n== Styles of address ==\n1834–1837: Mr John Dalberg-Acton\n1837–1855: Sir John Dalberg-Acton \n1855–1859: Sir John Dalberg-Acton \n1859–1866: Sir John Dalberg-Acton \n1866–1869: Sir John Dalberg-Acton \n1869–1897: The Right Honourable The Lord Acton \n1897–1902: The Right Honourable The Lord Acton \n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== Notable quotations ==\nHistory is the arbiter of controversy, the monarch of all she surveys.\nUniversal History is ... not a burden on the memory but an illumination of the soul.\nThere is not a more perilous or immoral habit of mind than the sanctifying of success.

Barrichello regained the lead on lap 36, until Montoya took over the position on lap 42 when Barrichello made a pit stop for the second time. Barrichello started to reduce the gap between himself and Montoya but was unable to challenge the Williams driver who won his first Formula One victory.\nThe result meant Montoya moved up into fifth place in the Drivers\' Championship, 83 points behind leader Michael Schumacher who clinched the title two races beforehand. Barrichello\'s third position finish allowed him to close the gap to David Coulthard. Williams\' strong finish meant the gap between themselves and McLaren was reduced to eight points with two races remaining in the season.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams with two drivers each. The teams (also known as constructors) were Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Benetton, BAR, Jordan, Arrows, Sauber, Jaguar, Minardi and Prost. Before the race, both the Drivers\' Championship and Constructors\' Championship were already settled, with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having claimed the Drivers\' Championship two rounds earlier in the Hungarian Grand Prix and Ferrari took the Constructors\' Championship at the same event, with McLaren too many points behind to be able to catch them.\nAfter the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, the teams conducted mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September to prepare for the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an electronic control unit failure and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team\'s private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.\nAfter the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington D.C., Formula One\'s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l\'Automobile (FIA) announced that the Italian Grand Prix would go ahead as scheduled. Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said that his team would approach the race as a normal racing event instead of a traditional Ferrari festival. Furthermore, di Montezemolo stated Formula One should continue its normal schedule and not cancel races. Additionally, the Automobile Club d\'Italia urged fans and spectators to behave "in keeping with the gravity of the situation and in collective participation in the pain of American citizens." Podium celebrations were also cancelled and all pre-race ceremonies including a flypast by the Italian Tricolour Arrows display team were called off. Three teams altered their car\'s liveries as a mark of respect. Ferrari stripped their cars of all advertising and painted their nose cones black. Jaguar fitted black engine covers to their R2 cars on Saturday morning, and Jordan sponsor Deutsche Post replaced its branding with the flag of the United States on the Jordan cars engine cover on Sunday morning. Michael Schumacher was reluctant to take part in the race and said in 2002 that he felt it was a "bad sign" to be driving after the September 11 attacks.\nThere were two driver changes heading into the race. The Minardi team replaced regular driver Tarso Marques with Yoong. Yoong received backing from the Magnum Corporation and was granted a super licence after a two-day test at the Mugello Circuit. He became the first Malaysian driver to compete in Formula One. Marques was kept on as the team\'s test and reserve driver, and assisted with developing the Minardi PS02. Czech Formula 3000 driver Tomáš Enge (who had been signed as the test driver for Prost) replaced Luciano Burti who had been recovering from an concussion and bruising he sustained in an accident at the previous race in Belgium.\nDue to the configuration of the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, with its high average speed, the teams set up their cars to produce the minimum amount of downforce possible. Williams introduced a revised FW23 specification for Montoya after one was used by Ralf Schumacher in Belgium. Williams equipped the earlier aerodynamic package on Ralf Schumacher\'s car on Sunday morning. Benetton brought a new front wing and Ferrari debuted a new engine specification with improved aerodynamics.\n\n\n=== Practice and qualifying sessions ===\n\nFour practice sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour; the third and fourth sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each. The first practice session was moved from the usual start time from 11:00 Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00) to 10:50 to comply with a planned silence for one minute that was observed at 12:00 throughout Europe. Michael Schumacher set the pace in the first practice session, which took place in dry weather conditions, with a time of 1:25.524; David Coulthard had the second-fastest time. Barrichello was third fastest, ahead of Nick Heidfeld (who crashed his car at Variante Ascari) in fourth. Mika Häkkinen recorded the fifth fastest time, with Jenson Button in sixth. Kimi Räikkönen, who was seventh fastest, collided with a barrier at Variante Goodyear which removed his front-right wheel. Ralf Schumacher, Jarno Trulli and Pedro de la Rosa rounded out the session\'s top ten fastest drivers. Arrows driver Jos Verstappen did not set a lap time because he collided with a tyre barrier at the Curva di Lesmo early in the session. In the second practice session, where a brief rain shower hit the circuit early in the session, Ralf Schumacher set the fastest time of the day, a 1:24.667; Montoya had the second fastest time despite going off the circuit during the session. Michael Schumacher (with a time of 1:25.131) was third fastest, ahead of de la Rosa. Barrichello, Häkkinen and Coulthard filled the next three positions. Despite not going onto the circuit, Heidfeld was the eighth fastest driver. Alesi and Heinz-Harald Frentzen (who slowed in his car and went off the circuit and slid wide of the track and avoided colliding with the barriers) followed in the top ten.\nMontoya took the fastest lap of the third practice session, a 1:25.558 which was held on a damp track. Barrichello was second fastest with a time 0.336 slower than Montoya. de la Rosa was running quickly and set the third fastest lap, a 1:26.542. BAR drivers Villeneuve and Panis set the fourth and fifth fastest times. Räikkönen, Eddie Irvine, Verstappen, Enrique Bernoldi and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. Giancarlo Fisichella, Yoong, Jenson Button, Jean Alesi, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Häkkinen and Fernando Alonso did not set lap times during the session. The circuit dried up for the final practice session where Michael Schumacher had the fastest lap of the weekend so far with a 1:23.178; Barrichello had the fastest time when circuit conditions improved but fell to fourth. The two Ferrari drivers were separated by Montoya and Trulli. Coulthard was fifth quickest with Ralf Schumacher sixth. Heidfeld, Häkkinen, de la Rosa and Räikkönen rounded out the top ten drivers ahead of qualifying. Enge spun but regained control of his car.\nSaturday afternoon\'s qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers\' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time to qualify for the race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel confident that he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car\'s balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.\nThe two Sauber drivers were eighth and ninth with Heidfeld in front of Räikkönen; Heidfeld was happy with his position after losing track time on Friday while Räikkönen complained that he had been blocked by Fisichella who was on an out lap. de la Rosa rounded out the top ten qualifiers and was happy after Jaguar engineer Humphrey Corbett corrected an issue with understeer on de la Rosa\'s car. Button took eleventh position and reported that his Benetton was well balanced. Frentzen took twelfth and said his qualifying position was more significant than his fourth-place finish in the Belgian Grand Prix. Irvine struggled with brake balance which shifted towards the rear of his Jaguar which meant he managed thirteenth. He also was unable to set a faster time after Olivier Panis blocked him by driving to the first corner apex and stopped his car. Fisichella used his Benetton team\'s spare car because his race car developed an hyradulic failure in practice but had an engine issue in the spare car which restricted him to fourteenth. BAR drivers Jacques Villeneuve and Panis took the fifteenth and seventeenth positions and both reported that there was a lack of aerodynamic grip but mechanical grip was fine. The two were separated by Alesi in the slower of the two Jordan cars and described his session as " the worst qualifying session I could imagine on a circuit which love" because he had brake balance and handling issues. Verstappen and Bernoldi took the eighteenth and nineteenth positions for the Arrows team. Enge set the twentieth fastest time in his first Formula One qualifying session, and had two engine problems in both his race car and the spare monocoque tuned for Frentzen. The two Minardi drivers qualified at the rear of the field with Fernando Alonso ahead of Yoong; both drivers stopped on their out laps with gearbox actuator failures and were required to share the spare Minardi car.\n\n\n=== Race ===\nThe drivers took to the track at 09:30 local time for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in sunny and warm weather conditions. Michael Schumacher maintained his good performance, setting a time of 1:26.029. Coulthard was the second-fastest driver. Montoya was third, two-tenths of a second behind Schumacher. Barrichello completed the top four fastest drivers. After the end of the warm-up but before the race, a second minute of silence was held at the end of the Drivers\' Parade.\n\nThe race started at 14:00 local time. The race was held in sunny weather conditions; the air temperature was 19 °C (66 °F) and the track temperature 26 °C (79 °F). During the buildup to the race, Michael Schumacher attempted to organise a pact that would see no overtaking at the first two chicanes. The plan failed, with Villeneuve, Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore and Arrows owner Tom Walkinshaw refusing to accept the pact. Schumacher had been keen to avoid any accidents at the start, due to a combination of the effects of the 11 September 2001 attacks earlier that week; the death of fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti in a pile-up at the beginning of the previous year\'s race; and the horrific accident in the previous day\'s ChampCar race in Germany, in which former Formula One driver Alex Zanardi was critically injured, resulting in the amputation of both legs.\nHeidfeld lost hydraulic pressure on the grid; he was required to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane. Fisichella did the same because he had a fuel leak in his car. When the race started, Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner, with Barrichello in second and Michael Schumacher in third. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for the position at the exit of Variante della Roggia and got ahead heading into the Curve di Lesmo. Further back, Trulli was hit by Button and was sent into a spin and became the first retirement of the race. Button made a pit stop at the end of the lap for a replacement front wing. Irvine made a good start, rising from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap, while Häkkinen made a poor gateway after going through the chicane to avoid making contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth. Verstappen made the best start, moving from nineteenth to eighth. At the end of the first lap, Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello, who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, de la Rosa, Irvine, Verstappen, Räikkönen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Bernoldi, Häkkinen, Panis, Frentzen, Alonso, Enge, Heidfeld, Yoong, Fisichella and Button.\nBarrichello and Michael Schumacher started to maintain the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started to pull away from Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button\'s engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his engine stopped working. Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16. Yoong spun at Curva di Lesmo and fell to the back of the field.\n\nMichael Schumacher battled for Montoya for third position until he became the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 18, and rejoined the track in fourth place. The Williams and Ferrari teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Williams team were planning a one-stop strategy whereas the Ferrari team were planning for two stops. Barrichello (on a lighter fuel load) was able to quickly extend his lead over Montoya to ten seconds by his first pit stop on lap 19. However, Barrichello\'s pit stop proved problematic: his refuelling rig failed to work which meant he was stationary for around six to seven seconds longer than planned. Barrichello exited the stop in third position, ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen lost second during the course of the 19th lap, and then lost all gears on the previous lap which forced him to retire. Verstappen retired on the 26th lap because his engine stopped working. At the front of the field, Ralf Schumacher moved into the lead of the race when Montoya made his pit stop on lap 28, where his pit crew made an adjustment to his front wing to rectify an issue Montoya had with oversteer, and he rejoined in third place with a deficit of 5.5 seconds. Frentzen retired from ninth position with a gearbox failure on lap 29. Villeneuve made a pit stop from sixth on lap 34 and retained the position.\nRalf Schumacher opened a gap of 6.1 seconds over Barrichello by his one and only pit stop on lap 35 and rejoined in fourth. de la Rosa was the last one-stop driver to pit on lap 36 from fifth, which he maintained upon rejoining the track. Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop on lap 40, and dropped behind Ralf Schumacher. Montoya moved back into the lead position when Barrichello made a pit stop on lap 41 and rejoined right behind Ralf Schumacher. At the completion of lap 42, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the order was Montoya, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, de la Rosa, Villeneuve, Räikkönen, Alesi, Panis, Fisichella, Heidfeld, Bernoldi, Enge, Alonso and Yoong. Further down the field, Enge passed Bernoldi for twelfth on lap 43. Barrichello ran in the slipstream of Ralf Schumacher down the start/finish straight and Schumacher cut the Variante Goodyear chicane after attempting to defend his position, allowing Barrichello to take over second on lap 47. Yoong retired from the race on the same lap after he spun his car into a gravel trap. Bernoldi became the final retirement of the race when his car developed a crankshaft sensor problem on the same lap.\nBarrichello closed the gap between himself and Montoya but was unable to catch up to the Colombian who crossed the finish line on lap 53 to clinch his first Formula One victory. in a time of 1\'16:58.393 at an average speed of 239.321 kilometres per hour (148.707 mph). Barrichello finished in second position 5.1 seconds behind Montoya, Ralf Schumacher came in third, Michael Schumacher took fourth, de la Rosa took his best result of the season after he finished fifth and Villeneuve rounded out the points-scoring positions in sixth. Räikkönen was the final driver on the lead lap in a close seventh place, and Alesi, Panis, Fisichella, Heidfeld, Enge and Alonso were the last of the classified finishers.\n\n\n=== After the race ===\nThe top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Montoya said he was "so happy" and "pleased" that he won his first race which was the first for a Colombian driver. He also said that he was not frustrated on not achieving his first victory in the past fourteen races as he was not expecting to win during the season. Barrichello said that he felt that Ferrari put on "a good show" despite his slow pit stop from a fuel rig problem on lap 19. He also believed that his two-stop strategy was the right move and described his weekend as "one of my best". When asked if his car was inconsistent during the Grand Prix, Ralf Schumacher said this was not the case and stated although he had problem with his tyres he felt the Williams finish of first and third was "a great achievement".\nAlesi attacked Briatore\'s role in preventing the drivers from abiding by the pact that was to see no overtaking in the first two chicanes and told the Italian and French media that some team principals threatened their drivers if they did not race. Nevertheless, he was relieved that the race passed without any major incident and said the reason why the majority of the drivers supported Michael Schumacher was that he "behaved like a perfect leader". Villeneuve said to British television station ITV that he felt discussing a no overtaking pact at the race circuit was not the appropriate place: "We are race car drivers, Because we signed contracts before the season and everyone was happy to be a race car driver and to earn millions of dollars. Because we knew a year ago that there would be a race at Monza and nobody complained." FIA president Max Mosley stated that he disagreed with the pact and said that the drivers should have raised the concerns in the months leading up to the Grand Prix.\nThe result allowed Michael Schumacher to extend his lead in the Drivers\' Championship to 50 points over Coulthard. Barrichello\'s third-place finish allowed him to narrow the gap to Coulthard to be three points behind. Ralf Schumacher remained in fourth position, while Montoya\'s victory meant he moved into fifth. Ferrari remained in the lead of the Constructors\' Championship with an 80-point advantage over McLaren, who\'s points advantage over Williams had reduced to eight points. Sauber maintained fourth place, while BAR took over fifth position.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\n\n=== Qualifying ===\n\n\n=== Race ===\n\n\n== Championship standings after the race ==\nBold text indicates the World Champions.\n\nNote: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.\n\n\n== References ==', 'Out Run (アウトラン, Auto Ran) is an arcade game released by Sega in 1986. It was designed by Yu Suzuki and developed by Sega AM2. The game was a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the best-selling video games of its time. It is notable for its pioneering hardware and graphics, and innovative features such as a selectable soundtrack with music composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, along with nonlinear gameplay.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nOut Run is a 3D driving video game in which the player controls a Ferrari Testarossa Spider from a third-person rear perspective. The camera is placed near the ground, simulating a Ferrari driver\'s position and limiting the player\'s view into the distance. The road curves, crests and dips, which increases the challenge by obscuring upcoming obstacles such as traffic. The player\'s car cannot suffer damage from a collision, but will be slowed down and thus lose time.\nThe object of the game is to reach one of a variety of destinations against a timer. If the timer reaches zero, the game ends. The player periodically encounters checkpoints near junctions, which add time to the clock. At each junction, the player must choose one of two directions, each of which lead to different environments.\n\n\n== Development ==\nAccording to the game\'s designer, Yu Suzuki, the stages of Out Run are mostly based on European scenery, having toured Europe in a BMW 520 for two weeks in order to get ideas. His original concept was to base the game on the America-located film The Cannonball Run (1981) but he largely switched the setting to Europe which he felt offered greater landscape variation. The game\'s backgrounds and roadside objects include old stone buildings, the Alps, windmills, and Stonehenge-like formations. Suzuki did, however, include American locations such as Devil\'s Canyon and Death Valley.\n\n\n=== Arcade hardware and software ===\nThe arcade game features raster graphics on a color CRT monitor and amplified stereophonic sound. There are a total of four cabinet designs (two upright and two sit-down), all of which are equipped with a steering wheel with force feedback, a stick shift plus acceleration and brake pedals. The upright cabinet came in two versions: Normal and Mini. The sit-down cabinets resembled the in-game car and used a drive motor to move the main cabinet — turning and shaking according to the onscreen action. There were two versions of the sit down: the Deluxe version featured a 26-inch color monitor and a custom molded seat, while the Standard featured a more simplified design and a 20-inch color monitor.\n\nRunning on the Sega OutRun arcade system board, the game achieved its 3D effects using a sprite-scaling technique called \'Super-Scaler\' technology (first used one year earlier in Hang-On and Space Harrier). This allowed a large number of scaled sprites to be displayed on the screen at the same time. Like the Sega Space Harrier games, the pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling in Out Run was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Sega AM2\'s Yu Suzuki stated that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D."\n\n\n=== Music ===\nOut Run\'s original score was composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, who had previously composed soundtracks for other games designed by Suzuki, and was a part of the S.S.T. Band, Sega\'s in-house band at the time. Out Run was the first video arcade game that allowed the user to choose the background music. The soundtrack consisted of both jazz fusion, similar in style to that of Casiopea, and Latin/Caribbean music, similar to Miami Sound Machine. In all, three selectable tracks were featured: Passing Breeze, Splash Wave and Magical Sound Shower. An additional track, Last Wave, played at the final score screen.\nThe 1991 Mega Drive/Genesis port added an additional track entitled Step On Beat, written by Masayoshi Ishi. The 2014 Nintendo 3DS version features two additional tracks, titled Cruising Line and Camino a Mi Amor, composed respectively using the original game\'s sound hardware by Manabu Namiki and Jane-Evelyn "Chibi-Tech" Nisperos. In more recent years, the game\'s music greatly inspired a musical genre known as synthwave.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOut Run was received very favorably. In 1988, it won the Golden Joystick Award for 1987\'s Game of the Year, beating Renegade and The Last Ninja. Out Run also received the Arcade Game of the Year award, beating Renegade and Bubble Bobble.\n\n\n=== Arcade reception ===\nOut Run became one of the most popular arcade games. It was the best-selling arcade game of the year, having sold over 20,000 arcade cabinets within a year. By 1994, it had sold 30,000 cabinets worldwide.\nClare Edgeley reviewed the arcade game in both Computer and Video Games (January 1987) and in Sinclair User (February 1987), praising the graphics and the element of danger in the gameplay. A review in Commodore User (March 1987) described it as "a great game for driving enthusiasts" and awarded it a score of 9 out of 10. Gary Penn, writing for Crash (April 1987) called the game "highly polished" and praised the attention to detail. In Your Sinclair (August 1987), Peter Shaw praised its realism and described it as "the most frighteningly fast road race game I\'ve ever played".\n\n\n=== Home console reception ===\nOut Run was converted to numerous home consoles (see below). The 8-bit computer game ports published by U.S. Gold sold more than 250,000 by Christmas 1987. Out Run became both the fastest-selling and the best-selling computer game in the UK that year.\nThe Sega Master System version was praised. Computer and Video Games (October 1987) concluded that it had "all the thrill power of the arcade version." The Games Machine gave the Master System version a score of 72%, stating that the Master System version came closest to the original coin-op. Reviewers for Dragon described it as a \'refreshing\' game \'that provides hours of entertainment\'. Computer Gaming World named it as the year\'s best arcade translation for Sega.\nThe reception for the 8-bit personal computer ports published elsewhere by U.S. Gold was mixed. The ZX Spectrum version received positive scores from Your Sinclair and Sinclair User. Some reviewers at Crash expressed disappointment at the low quality in contrast to the arcade original. The Games Machine gave the Spectrum version a score of 61%, noting the machine\'s technical limitations in comparison to the Master System and Commodore systems.\nThe Commodore versions received positive to average reviews, though Computer and Video Games described the Commodore 64 port as "rushed". The Amstrad CPC port received a score of 8 out of 40 from Computer and Video Games, which described it as a "travesty".\nReactions to the 16-bit versions were generally positive. The Atari ST version (1988) was described by Computer and Video Games as "far from perfect," but that it came closer to the arcade original than the other ports. The 1991 Mega Drive / Genesis version was well received.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThere have been numerous follow-up titles to Out Run, including Out Run 3-D (1988), Turbo Out Run (1989), and OutRunners (1992), among many others. Out Run 2 was released on the Xbox in 2003 to acclaim, and has been followed by further titles.\nCoconut Beach, the first stage in Out Run, makes an appearance in Sega Superstars Tennis as a playable court. A course named "OutRun Bay" appears in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed as a free download to those who purchase the Bonus Edition. The full game was featured as a minigame in Yakuza 0\n"Magical Sound Shower", one of the game\'s songs was given official lyrics that were sung by the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku. The song was featured in the games Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Arcade and Miku Flick.\nIn 2015, OutRun appeared at 4th place on IGN\'s list of The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever, behind Pole Position, Gran Turismo and Virtua Racing. According to Luke Reilly, "traces of OutRun DNA can be found in series like Test Drive, Need for Speed, Project Gotham Racing, and Burnout" as well as "modern racers like the Forza Horizon games and DriveClub".\nOut Run has been listed among the best games of all time by publications such as Next Generation, Retro Gamer, Stuff, and Time, as well as organizations such as G4, Killer List of Videogames, NowGamer, and Yahoo!. Writing in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Joao Diniz Sanches praised Out Run\'s "unforgettable design and expertly tuned game balance", describing the title as "the consummate exhibit in an oversubscribed genre" and "one of the purest and most joyous experiences in video gaming."\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOut Run at MobyGames\nOut Run at the Killer List of Videogames\nOut Run at SpectrumComputing.co.uk\nOut Run — in-depth comparison of all conversions at ExoticA.', 'A Fair Maiden is a 2010 novella by Joyce Carol Oates that chronicles the relationship between teenage nanny Katya Spivak and the much older, affluent artist Marcus Kidder. The novel\'s themes and plot are reminiscent of Vladimir Nabokov\'s Lolita.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile walking her employers\' two children, sixteen year-old nanny Katya Spivak is approached by an old man, Marcus Kidder, who seems to take an interest in her. Mr. Kidder invites Katya to his house, and though the initial visits seem harmless, their relationship gradually develops into something of a darker nature.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing the book for The Washington Post, Jane Smiley analogized Oates\' prolific production to a large museum, and described this book as "a work that is not going to get a room of its own, or even a wall of its own, but it will fit neatly into the portrait gallery, and it deserves contemplation." Some other reviews were less positive. Publishers Weekly called the book "derivative and unpolished". Elizabeth Day in The Guardian said the book was a "disappointment" and that Oates had not succeeded in her effort to rework the themes of Lolita. Wendy Brandmark of The Independent noted some "fine moments" in the book but thought it was "too controlled".\n\n\n== References ==', "These are U.S. towns and villages flooded by the creation of dams, destroyed by the advancing sea, or washed away in floods and never rebuilt.\n\n\n== Alabama ==\nRiverton, under Pickwick Lake\n\n\n== Arkansas ==\nMonte Ne, under Beaver Lake\n\n\n== California ==\nBaird, under Shasta Lake\nCopper City, under Shasta Lake\nElmore, under Shasta Lake\nEtter, under Shasta Lake\nKennett, under Shasta Lake\nMorley, under Shasta Lake\nPitt, under Shasta Lake\nStringtown, under Trinity Lake\nWinthrop, under Shasta Lake\n\n\n== Colorado ==\nMontgomery, flooded by the creation of Montgomery Reservoir\nSopris, flooded by the creation of Trinidad Lake State Park Reservoir\n\n\n== Connecticut ==\nBarkhamstad Hollow, under Barkhamsted Reservoir\nHartland Hollow, under Barkhamsted Reservoir\n\n\n== Indiana ==\nDeaf Man's Village, under Mississinewa Reservoir\nSomerset, under Mississinewa Reservoir\n\n\n== Maine ==\nFlagstaff, under Flagstaff Lake\n\n\n== Massachusetts ==\nDana, under Quabbin Reservoir\nEnfield, under Quabbin Reservoir\nGreenwich, under Quabbin Reservoir\nPrescott, partially under Quabbin Reservoir\n\n\n== Michigan ==\nRawsonville, under Belleville Lake\n\n\n== Nevada ==\nSt. Thomas, under Lake Mead\n\n\n== New York ==\nArena, flooded by Pepacton Reservoir\nAshokan, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir and relocated\nAshton, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir\nBittersweet, flooded by Neversink Reservoir\nBoiceville, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir\nBrodhead, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir\nBrown's Station, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir\nCannonsville, flooded by Cannonsville Reservoir\nElko, flooded by Allegheny Reservoir\nEureka, flooded by Rondout Reservoir\nGilboa, flooded by Schoharie Reservoir and relocated\nGlenford, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir and relocated\nKensico, flooded by Kensico Reservoir\nLackawack, flooded by Rondout Reservoir\nMontela, flooded by Rondout Reservoir\nNeversink, flooded by Neversink Reservoir and relocated\nOlive, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir\nOlive Bridge, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir and relocated\nPepacton, flooded by Pepacton Reservoir\nShavertown, flooded by Pepacton Reservoir\nShokan, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir\nStony Hollow, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir\nUnion Grove, flooded by Pepacton Reservoir\nWest Hurley, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir and relocated\nWest Shokan, flooded by Ashokan Reservoir\n\n\n== Oregon ==\nArlington, flooded by Lake Umatilla but relocated\nBayocean, destroyed by erosion into the Pacific Ocean\nBlalock, inundated by the backwaters from the John Day Dam\nCarter, under Lookout Point Reservoir\nCelilo, flooded by Lake Celilo\nChampoeg, destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862\nCopper, under Applegate Reservoir\nDetroit, inundated by Detroit Lake and relocated\nDorena, flooded by Dorena Reservoir and relocated\nEula, under Lookout Point Reservoir\nHomestead, possibly under the Hells Canyon Reservoir\nKlamath Junction, under Emigrant Lake\nLandax (also known as Signal), under Lookout Point Reservoir\nLawler, under Lookout Point Reservoir\nLaurelhurst, under Lost Creek Lake\nLinn City, destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862\nOrleans, destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862\nReserve, under Lookout Point Reservoir\nRobinette, under Brownlee Reservoir\nSantiam City, destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862\nSyracuse, destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862\nVanport, destroyed by the flooding of the Columbia River\nWatson, under Owyhee Reservoir\n\n\n== Pennsylvania ==\nCorydon, flooded by Allegheny Reservoir\nLivermore, flooded by the Conemaugh Dam\nKinzua, flooded by Allegheny Reservoir\nMilford Mills, flooded by creation of Marsh Creek Dam\nWilsonville, PA, flooded to create Lake Wallenpaupack\n\n\n== Utah ==\nAdventure, destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862\nConnellsville, flooded by Electric Lake\nHailstone, flooded by Jordanelle Reservoir\nKeetley, flooded by Jordanelle Reservoir\nLinwood, flooded by Flaming Gorge Reservoir\nRockport, flooded by Rockport Reservoir\nStringtown, flooded by Pineview Reservoir\n\n\n== Washington ==\nVantage, flooded by the Wanapum Dam\n\n\n== External links ==\nInundated Underwater Cities\nAshokan Communities", 'Colma Creek is a small creek that flows toward the San Francisco Bay from near San Bruno Mountain. The source starts north of the Guadalupe Parkway. It flows down southwest and makes a 90 degree bend to flow southeastward. The creek loses elevation as it flows through the cities of Daly City and Colma, and continues to lose elevation until reaching the bay. Its small delta is just in between South San Francisco and the San Francisco International Airport. The creek has one named tributary stream named Twelvemile Creek.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe large delta the creek once supported was an important stop for migratory waterfowl and other wildlife. However, like many urban creeks, Colma Creek has been surrounded by flood control walls, buried in some parts, and had much of its large delta filled in by developers. Most of the lower parts of the creek are devoid of native vegetation due to the flood control project, reducing the habitat of the endangered California clapper rail and other species that use the creek. The headwaters of the creek are lined with non-native trees like eucalyptus, cypress, and Himalayan blackberry, displacing the native riparian plants like dogwood and willow. The creek sometimes runs dry due to the non-native vegetation lowering the water table at the source. In 2005, Shelterbelt Builders developed a habitat restoration plan to return the creek to its former state by removing invasive and non-native plants and replanting native, riparian plants at the source. In addition, in South San Francisco, new wetland was created to mitigate wetland lost to floodwall construction and improvements. The California clapper rail is expected to reinhabit the new salt and freshwater wetland, along with other species displaced by the flood control works.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of watercourses in the San Francisco Bay Area\n\n\n== References ==', 'Asim Ali (born 18 February 1996) is a Pakistani cricketer.

Many of them are organized by local government bodies together with not-for-profit organisations and the like, and serve as the administrative window concerned with attracting and supporting the productions that come to their locality, not only from other parts of their own countries, but from abroad, as well. The Association of Film Commissioners International or AFCI is based in Los Angeles. The mission of the AFCI is to be essential to the advancement and promotion of excellence in the global production of media on location, in an ethical and professional manner, and to this end the organization sets standards and provides professional education, training and business services in the field of Film Commissioning.\nThe European Film Commissions Network or EUFCN www.eufcn.net is based in Bruxelles. The Asian Film Commissions Network or AFCNet www.afcnet.org gathers now film commissions on the Asian continent.\nA major industry event and trade show is the Locations Trade Show which is organised by the AFCI. In 2011 the Locations Show was produced in association with the Producers’ Guild of America’s Produced By Conference.\nFilm commissions believe that by attracting productions to their area they can provide direct economic benefit through rental of hotel rooms, locations, vehicles, etc., and indirect economic benefit via the increased exposure of appearing in films and television.\n\n\n== History ==\n"The first Commission was formed in the United States during the late 1940s. This was in response to the need for film companies to have a local government liaison who could coordinate local services such as police, state troopers and highway patrols, road and highway departments, fire departments, park rangers and all of the other essential municipal and government services for shooting a production on location. As more production companies began to look beyond the limits of a regular production center for realistic and varied locations, more cities and states began to see the need for production coordination liaison."\n\n\n== Economics ==\nFilm commissions can benefit both the production company and the area they decide to shoot at. The production company can potentially save money by shooting out of state and hiring cheaper below-the-line labor, shooting on location as opposed to building a set in a studio, etc. The economy at the location they shoot at can benefit via profits from hotel rooms, food, gas stations, and any other amenities that the above-the-line labor will use throughout the duration of the filming.\nHowever, shooting out of Hollywood does affect those who still work in Hollywood. Below-the-line workers based in Hollywood have a smaller job market because production continues to move out of state.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe following are websites that aggregate film commissions 1,100+ film commissions.\nFilmCommissioners.com Lists over 1,100+ film commissions around the world.\nAssociation Of Film Commissioners International Lists only its member film commissions.\nEuropean Film Commissions Network European Film Commissions Network\nAsian Film Commissions Network Asian Film Commissions Network\nCinematographic Film Production European Seminar\nTerritorialisation Expenses on a Film Production\nShoot in Ouarzazate Ouarzazate Film Commission - Morocco', 'Rutgerus Johannes Martinus "Ruud" van Nistelrooy (Dutch: Ruud van Nistelrooij; [ˈryt fɑn ˈnɪstəlroːi̯] ( listen); born 1 July 1976) is a retired Dutch footballer and a current manager for the PSV youth team. A former striker, he is the fourth-highest goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history with 56 goals. He is a three-time Champions League top scorer, as well as a top scorer in three different European domestic leagues.\nVan Nistelrooy began his career with Den Bosch, before moving onto Heerenveen, eventually making a name for himself at PSV, where he won two Eredivisie titles. His goalscoring record at PSV attracted attention from Manchester United; a deal was in place in the summer of 2000, but because of injury problems, his move was secured a year later for a then British record fee of £19 million. His time at United was successful, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Football League Cup and FA Community Shield, along with winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year twice. Van Nistelrooy hit 150 goals in just 219 games for United, as well as becoming, at the time, their all time European record goalscorer, but fell out of favour towards the end of his tenure. Real Madrid then secured his services in 2006. Although an injury blighted the end of his days with Madrid, he did win La Liga twice and the Supercopa de España before signing for Hamburger SV during the January transfer window in 2010. After one-and-a-half seasons with Hamburg, he moved back to Spain with Málaga in the summer of 2011. His retirement from football was announced on 14 May 2012.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\n\n\n==== Early club career ====\nBorn in Oss, North Brabant, Van Nistelrooy started his professional career in 1993 with Dutch second division side Den Bosch, where he was converted from a central midfielder to centre forward after playing part-time for Nooit Gedacht and Margriet. After netting 12 goals in 31 games in the 1996–97 campaign, he transferred for €360,000 to Heerenveen the next year, and scored 13 goals in 31 matches in his only season with the club. He was then signed by PSV the next season for €6.3 million, a then-record transfer sum between two Dutch teams.\nHe scored 31 goals in 34 matches, the highest season total in the Eredivisie and second-highest in Europe overall, in addition to scoring all three of PSV\'s goals in a Champions League match against HJK Helsinki on 25 November 1998. Van Nistelrooy capped off the year by winning the Dutch Player of the Year award. The following season, he won his second Eredivisie scoring title with 29 goals. According to a 2001 interview with The Daily Telegraph, Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson said that his son Darren, who was at try-outs for Eredivisie rival Heerenveen at the time, begged his father, "You\'ve got to sign Van Nistelrooy right away, he\'s fantastic. We\'ve been watching him." Ferguson sent team representatives to PSV\'s next league game and signed Van Nistelrooy the next day.\n\n\n==== Manchester United ====\n\nVan Nistelrooy looked set to complete a club record £18.5 million transfer to Manchester United in the summer of 2000. He was to be unveiled at a press conference four days later, but this was instead used to announce that the transfer had been postponed over concerns about his fitness, having not played for a month due to problems with his knee. The transfer was then cancelled after PSV refused to agree to further medical tests, and the next day he suffered a rupture to his anterior cruciate knee ligaments during a training session, leaving him injured for a year.\nA year later, Van Nistelrooy signed a five-year contract after passing his medical. He downplayed United\'s £19 million investment to reporters, saying, "The price is not heavy for me – it lifts me up because it means United have big confidence in me."\n\n\n===== 2001–02 =====\nVan Nistelrooy made his debut in the Charity Shield against Liverpool, scoring in a 2–1 loss. On 19 August, Van Nistelrooy made his Premier League debut against Fulham at Old Trafford, and scored two goals to help United to a 3–2 win. He scored his first Champions League goals on 17 October in a 3–2 loss to Deportivo de La Coruña.\nOn 22 December, Van Nistelrooy scored his first Premier League hat-trick in a 6–1 win against Southampton. In the FA Cup, Van Nistelrooy started on the bench for the Third Round tie against Aston Villa due to a groin strain, but was substituted on for Luke Chadwick in the second-half with United 2–0 down and scored two "sublime" goals in three minutes to help United advance to the fourth round with a 3–2 win.\nIn total during his first season, Van Nistelrooy scored 23 goals in 32 league games. He broke the record he shared with Mark Stein, Alan Shearer and Thierry Henry, by scoring in eight consecutive league games. He also scored 10 Champions League goals, and was named the PFA Players\' Player of the Year.\n\n\n===== 2002–03 =====\nThe following season, he finished as the top Premier League scorer with 25 goals in 34 games, with a goal on the final day against Everton earning him the Golden Boot ahead of Arsenal\'s Thierry Henry. His tally included three hat-tricks against Newcastle United, Fulham, and Charlton Athletic. He also scored in each of the final eight games of the season as United won the title. Van Nistelrooy won the Premier League Player of the Season in 2003. He was accredited with spearheading the title win for United with a goal tally that was described as "astonishing". After scoring 12 Champions League goals, he was named by UEFA as the best striker in Europe.\n\n\n===== 2003–04 =====\n\nVan Nistelrooy started the 2003–04 season by scoring twice in his first two league matches. This meant he had scored in 10 consecutive league games, then a Premier League record, which stood until 2015 when Jamie Vardy scored in 11 consecutive matches. In the 0–0 draw on 21 September 2003, later dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford, Van Nistelrooy was at the centre of one of the most infamous incidents of the Arsenal–Manchester United rivalry. After missing a last-minute penalty that would have won the game for United, Van Nistelrooy was attacked by Martin Keown, prompting a melee involving several players from both sides; five Arsenal players including Keown received various bans and fines, while the club itself received a record fine of £175,000. Earlier in the game, he had been fouled by Patrick Vieira, who was sent off for a second bookable offence. Vieira and his manager Arsène Wenger both accused Van Nistelrooy of cheating and stamping on Vieira, prompting a vociferous defence by Alex Ferguson.\nOn 27 September, he scored a hat-trick against Leicester City in a 4–1 victory. He scored his 100th goal for the club in a dramatic 4–3 victory over Everton on 7 February 2004.\nIn the FA Cup fifth round derby against Manchester City, Van Nistelrooy scored twice to help ten-man United win 4–2, and again scored twice in the quarter-final against Fulham as United came from behind to win 2–1. He scored a further two goals, including one penalty, in United\'s victory over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final.\n\n\n===== 2004–05 =====\nVan Nistelrooy missed a large part of the 2004–05 season due to injury, but nonetheless scored a Champions League-best eight goals. One of them was his 30th career European goal, which he scored in a 2–2 Champions League group stage draw with Lyon on 16 September 2004, overtaking Denis Law\'s previous club record of 28 goals. Law later said to reporters, "I\'m delighted for Ruud. It could not happen to a nicer guy."\nOn 24 October, Arsenal returned to Old Trafford for another dramatic fixture. Arsenal entered the fixture with 49-game unbeaten run and had been dubbed "The Invincibles", but United won the game 2–0. Van Nistelrooy scored the opening goal from the penalty spot, atoning for the penalty miss the previous year, with Wayne Rooney scoring a second. Van Nistelrooy was later banned for three games for a foul on Ashley Cole that the referee had missed. On 3 November, Van Nistelrooy scored all four goals in a 4–1 win against Sparta Prague. On 17 April 2005, he scored two goals in the FA Cup semi-final in a 4–1 win against Newcastle, but United lost the final on penalties to Arsenal.\n\n\n===== 2005–06 =====\n\nAt the start of the 2005–06 season, Van Nistelrooy scored in United\'s first four Premier League games. He finished as the second-highest league scorer with 21 goals, behind Arsenal\'s Thierry Henry. However, he was benched for the League Cup Final against Wigan Athletic, fuelling speculation of a rift between him and Alex Ferguson, which Van Nistelrooy denied. He was nonetheless left on the bench for six consecutive league matches, and though he then returned to the starting line-up and scored match-winners against West Ham United and Bolton Wanderers, fresh doubt spread over Van Nistelrooy\'s future when he was benched for United\'s season finale win over Charlton Athletic. Ferguson claimed that Van Nistelrooy was angry at the decision and left the stadium three hours before kick-off. On 9 May 2006, it was reported that Van Nistelrooy\'s exclusion from the squad was due to a training session fight between him and teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. Van Nistelrooy allegedly criticised Ronaldo\'s tendency to hold onto the ball instead of passing to his teammates, which sparked the fight, after which Van Nistelrooy remarked, "Go crying to your daddy," which was in reference to United\'s then Portuguese assistant manager, Carlos Queiroz. Ronaldo, however, took the statement literally and allegedly broke into tears since his father José had died eight months previously. Van Nistelrooy later apologised to Ferguson for his behaviour in the previous few months.\nVan Nistelrooy signed with Spanish La Liga side Real Madrid on 28 July, departing Old Trafford after five seasons with a total of 150 goals in 219 appearances, with his final goal coming on 1 April against Bolton, scoring what proved to be the winning goal. With 38 goals, he is also the club\'s second all-time European goalscorer, behind Wayne Rooney.\n\n\n==== Real Madrid ====\n\nOn 15 July 2006, Ferguson confirmed that Van Nistelrooy wanted to leave Manchester United and Real Madrid announced two weeks later that he had signed a three-year contract after being purchased for €14 million.\nVan Nistelrooy made his debut for the Spanish club in a 1–0 friendly win over Reggina on 4 August 2006. Van Nistelrooy scored a hat-trick in his second league match against Levante and, on 12 November 2006, he scored all four of Real Madrid\'s goals in a 4–1 victory over Osasuna. He won the league\'s Pichichi award with 25 goals as Real Madrid took home the 2006–07 title, and he also equalled the longest consecutive scoring streak in La Liga history with seven straight matches, tying a league record shared by Hugo Sánchez.\nIn January 2008, Van Nistelrooy signed a contract extension keeping him with Madrid until 2010, with the expiration date one day shy of his 34th birthday. He underwent ankle surgery in March, and returned for the El Clásico derby against Barcelona on 7 May, in which he netted a penalty two minutes after coming on as a substitute. He finished the season with 20 goals in 33 appearances.\n\nIn November 2008, Real Madrid announced that Van Nistelrooy would miss the remainder of the 2008–09 season after exploratory arthroscopic surgery revealed a partially torn meniscus in his right knee, with an expected recovery time of six to nine months following a second operation to repair the damage. Van Nistelrooy travelled to the United States to see specialist Richard Steadman, who had previously operated on the same knee back in 2000. At the time of his injury, he had 10 goals in 12 club appearances for the season. Following the injury, he was de-registered by Real Madrid for the rest of the 2008–09 season, and his shirt number was given to Dani Parejo. On 24 August 2009, in the last pre-season match before the start of La Liga, Van Nistelrooy stepped on the pitch for the first time since his injury and played the last 15 minutes of the game against Rosenborg, substituting Kaká. Van Nistelrooy came on for Cristiano Ronaldo in the 80th minute against Xerez in his first La Liga match since recovering from his injury. In the 81st minute, he provided the assist for a Karim Benzema goal, following it with his own 88th-minute goal. During his strike, however, he picked up a thigh injury, where it was later revealed by Real Madrid that he would be out from first team action for up to six weeks. On 27 October, Van Nistelrooy made his second comeback of the season coming on as a substitute for Raúl in the 71st minute against Alcorcón in the Copa del Rey.\n\n\n==== Hamburger SV ====\nOn 23 January 2010, Van Nistelrooy signed an 18-month contract with the German club Hamburger SV until June 2011. He made his first appearance for the club after coming off the bench in the last two minutes of Hamburg\'s 3–3 draw with 1. FC Köln on 6 February. Van Nistelrooy scored his first two goals for Hamburg on 13 February 2010 against VfB Stuttgart in the 75th and 77th minutes of a 3–1 win, after entering the game just a few minutes prior. On 11 March 2010, he scored his first UEFA Europa League goal in the 40th minute of Hamburg\'s match against Anderlecht.\nOn 15 August 2010, Van Nistelrooy scored his only competitive hat-trick with Hamburg, in a 5–1 win over Torgelower SV Greif in the first round of the 2010–11 DFB-Pokal. On 21 August 2010, he scored a brace in Hamburg\'s season opener against Schalke 04, which HSV won 2–1. During that match, he played against his friend and former Real Madrid teammate Raúl, who was making his Bundesliga debut. In the January transfer window, Van Nistelrooy was linked a return move back to Real Madrid and could be used for a short-term basis to cover, following injuries of Gonzalo Higuaín and Karim Benzema as manager José Mourinho would be happy for Van Nistelrooy to join the club as Mourinho left the door for him. Van Nistelrooy admitted he seriously considered moving back to the club if the bid happened. The club, however, rejected Madrid\'s bid for Van Nistelrooy, giving the club a warning as Hamburg wants to keep hold of him until the transfer window ended. Despite being angered over his move to Real Madrid rejected, Van Nistelrooy said he would remain committed at Hamburg. During a match between Hamburg and Hannover 96 on 16 April 2011, Van Nistelrooy suffered a calf injury that kept him out until the last matchday.\nVan Nistelrooy scored 7 goals and made 2 assists in 25 appearances in his only full season with Hamburg.\n\n\n==== Málaga ====\n\nOn 1 June 2011, Van Nistelrooy arrived at Málaga to sign a one-year contract with the La Liga club on a free transfer. After joining the club, Van Nistelrooy was presented at La Rosaleda Stadium as he was welcomed by 15,000 Málaga fans. Van Nistelrooy made his debut in a 2–1 loss against Sevilla on the opening game of the 2011–12 season.\nOn 1 October 2011, while playing against Getafe, Van Nistelrooy scored his first goal for Málaga. On 21 December, against the same club, he opened the scoring with a volley as Málaga won 3–2 on aggregate in the Copa del Rey. Later on in the season, Van Nistelrooy scored two more goals in the league against Espanyol and Racing de Santander, which was the last goal of his career. Just one day before his retirement, Van Nistelrooy made his last appearance of his career, coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute for goalscorer Salomón Rondón, who scored the only goal in the game against Sporting de Gijón.\nOn 14 May 2012, Van Nistelrooy announced his retirement from football at the age of 35. He told Sport1 he previously made hints that his football career was coming to an end after insisting Málaga would be his last club.\n\n\n=== International ===\nVan Nistelrooy earned 70 caps and scored 35 goals for the Netherlands. He made his debut for the national team in a friendly match against Germany on 18 November 1998. However, the cruciate ligament injury which postponed his transfer to Manchester United also ruled Van Nistelrooy out of UEFA Euro 2000.\nAs the Dutch failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Van Nistelrooy did not make his tournament debut for the Netherlands until Euro 2004, where he and the Czech Republic\'s Milan Baroš were the only players to score in all three group stage matches. The Netherlands reached the semi-finals where they were defeated by hosts Portugal 2–1. Van Nistelrooy was named in the tournament all-star team.\nDuring a 2006 World Cup qualifying match, he scored in the Dutch\'s 4–0 win over bottom-placed Andorra and was yellow-carded for going to Andorra player Antoni Lima and celebrating in front of him, following an incident six minutes before when Van Nistelrooy missed a penalty and Lima laughed at him. He was a part of coach Marco van Basten\'s squad for the 2006 World Cup finals, for which he served as the official FIFA/SOS ambassador. He started, and was substituted, in all of the Netherlands\' group stage matches, and scored his lone goal against the Ivory Coast. Van Nistelrooy was dropped to the bench by Van Basten without an explanation for the Netherlands\' second round match, which saw them again eliminated by Portugal.\n\nVan Basten left the striker out of the squad for a friendly against the Republic of Ireland on 16 August 2006. Dirk Kuyt replaced Van Nistelrooy in their next match against Portugal in September. After Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was unavailable for Euro 2008 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Belarus due to injury, Van Nistelrooy refused Van Basten\'s request to take his place on the roster.\nOn 23 January 2007, Van Nistelrooy announced his retirement from international football following continued disputes with Van Basten, which had started back in 2006 during the course of the World Cup finals matches. After several phone conversations and at the persuasion of veteran goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, however, both player and coach put aside their differences. Van Basten announced four months later that Van Nistelrooy was returning to the Oranje. On 8 September, Van Nistelrooy filled Huntelaar\'s spot, as previously requested, for the qualifier against Bulgaria, scoring in a 2–0 victory, and scored the winning goal four days later in injury time of the Netherlands\' win over Albania.\nAt Euro 2008, Van Nistelrooy scored for the Netherlands in their decisive 3–0 victory over Italy in the group stage, and scored the equaliser in their eventual 3–1 loss to Russia in the quarter-finals. On 4 August, he again announced his retirement from international competition.\nDuring the buildup to the 2010 World Cup, Van Nistelrooy again made himself available, but was left out by the Netherlands\' new coach Bert van Marwijk. After being left out for the World Cup, Van Nistelrooy said he had no choice but to face the fact that his international career is finished.\nAfter main striker Robin van Persie suffered an injury during a match with his club Arsenal, Van Marwijk gave Van Nistelrooy a chance to reclaim his position as the main striker of the Netherlands\' national team. Van Nistelrooy was invited to two Netherlands\' Group E qualification matches for Euro 2012 against San Marino and Finland. He scored in the 5–0 victory against San Marino on 3 September 2010.\nHe was again recalled to the squad in March 2011 for two Euro 2012 qualification games with Hungary, after injuries to strikers Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Arjen Robben and Theo Janssen. In the away game on 25 March, he appeared as a late substitute for Dirk Kuyt while in the return game in Amsterdam four days later, he came off the bench to score his 35th international goal. adding it is "wonderful to be able to add something to this Oranje team", as he told Berend Scholten.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\n\n\n=== PSV ===\nIn June 2013, Van Nistelrooy joined PSV as a coaching intern working with the under-17s.\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nIn March 2014, it was announced that Van Nistelrooy would be assisting Guus Hiddink after the 2014 World Cup.\n\n\n== Outside football ==\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nVan Nistelrooy married his girlfriend, Leontien Slaats, in July 2004. The couple had their first child, a girl named Moa Annette, in September 2006, and a son named Liam in March 2008. Van Nistelrooy was brought up as a Roman Catholic.\n\n\n=== Charity ===\nVan Nistelrooy and his wife are both heavily involved with the charity organization SOS Children\'s Villages. The organization has been around since 1949 and is an international development charity which serves to protect the interests and rights of children. Van Nistelrooy was officially appointed "FIFA for SOS Children\'s Villages" Ambassador in the Netherlands on 1 September 2001.\nOn 17 November 2009, Van Nistelrooy and his wife hosted SOS at Ciudad Real Madrid. The purpose of the event was to help create a calendar which would be sold to benefit the organization.\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\nVan Nistelrooy was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a "Secret Tournament" commercial (branded "Scorpion KO") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Edgar Davids, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament "referee".\n\n\n=== Media career ===\nDuring the 2014 World Cup, Van Nistelrooy worked as a studio analyst for ESPN.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\n\n\n=== International ===\n\n(Source)\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nPSV\nEredivisie: 1999–2000, 2000–01\nJohan Cruijff Shield: 1998\nManchester United\nPremier League: 2002–03\nFA Cup: 2003–04\nFootball League Cup: 2005–06\nFA Community Shield: 2003\nReal Madrid\nLa Liga: 2006–07, 2007–08\nSupercopa de España: 2008\n\n\n=== Individual ===\nEredivisie top goalcorer: 1998–99, 1999–2000\nDutch Footballer of the Year: 1999, 2000\nPremier League Player of the Month: December 2001, February 2002, April 2003\nUEFA Champions League top goalscorer: 2001–02, 2002–03, 2004–05\nUEFA Champions League top assist provider: 2001–02\nSir Matt Busby Player of the Year: 2001–02, 2002–03\nESM Team of the Year: 2001–02\nIFFHS World\'s Top Goal Scorer of the Year: 2002\nPFA Fans\' Player of the Year: 2001–02\nPFA Players\' Player of the Year: 2001–02\nPFA Premier League Team of the Year: 2001–02, 2003–04\nPremier League Goal of the Month: March 2003\nPremier League Player of the Season: 2002–03\nPremier League Golden Boot: 2002–03\nUEFA Club Forward of the Year: 2002–03\nFA Cup top goalscorer: 2002–03, 2003–04\nUEFA Team of the Year: 2003\nFIFA 100\nUEFA Euro Team of the Tournament: 2004\nPichichi Trophy: 2006–07\nIFFHS World\'s Top Goal Scorer of the Last Decade: 2012\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRuud van Nistelrooij – FIFA competition record\nRuud van Nistelrooy at BDFutbol\nRuud van Nistelrooy at Soccerbase \nRuud van Nistelrooy at National-Football-Teams.com\nRuud van Nistelrooy on IMDb\nRuud van Nistelrooy at Wereld van Oranje (in Dutch)', "This is a list of heads of state, government leaders, and other rulers in the year 1848.\n\n\n== Africa ==\nAshanti Confederacy – Kwaku Dua I Panyin, Asantehene (1834–1867)\nKingdom of Buganda – Suna II (1836–1856)\nBunyoro –\nNyabongo II, Omukama of Bunyoro (1835–1848)\nOlimi V, Omukama of Bunyoro (1848–1852)\n\nKingdom of Burundi – Ntare IV Rugamba (1796–1852)\nKingdom of Dahomey – Ghezo (1818–1856)\nGeledi Sultanate –\nYusuf Mahamud Ibrahim (1798–1848)\nAhmed Yusuf (1848–1878)\n\nLiberia – Joseph Jenkins Roberts, President of Liberia (1848–1856)\nKingdom of Rwanda – Mutara II Rwogera (1830–1853)\nSokoto Caliphate\nCaliph – Ali bin Bello I (1842–1859)\nGrand Vizier -

The combined area of these marine protected areas is 21.49 square miles, with 9.38 in the SMR, and 12.11 in the adjacent SMCA. Point Reyes SMR prohibits the take of all living marine resources. Point Reyes SMCA prohibits the take of all living marine resources, except the recreational and commercial take of Dungeness crab by pot and salmon by trolling.\n\n\n== History ==\nPoint Reyes SMR and Point Reyes SMCA are two of 22 marine protected areas adopted by the California Department of Fish and Game in August 2009, during the second phase of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The MLPAI is a collaborative public process to create a statewide network of protected areas along California’s coastline.\nThe north central coast’s new marine protected areas were designed by local divers, fishermen,conservationists and scientists who comprised the North Central Coast Regional Stakeholder Group. Their job was to design a network of protected areas that would preserve sensitive sea life and habitats while enhancing recreation, study and education opportunities.\nThe north central coast marine protected areas took effect on May 1, 2010.\n\n\n== Geography and natural features ==\nPoint Reyes SMR and Point Reyes SMCA are two adjoining marine protected areas that extend offshore of Point Reyes Headlands and within Drakes Bay in Marin County on California’s north central coast. The SMR is onshore and the SMCA is offshore. Point Reyes is a spectacular and biologically diverse peninsula which has been designated a National Seashore.\nPoint Reyes SMR is bounded by the mean high tide line straight lines connecting the following points in the order listed:\n37° 59.90’N. lat. 123° 01.29’W. long.; 37° 59.90’N. lat. 123° 02.00’W. long.; 37° 59.00’N. lat. 123° 02.00’W. long.; 37° 59.00’N. lat. 122° 57.34’W. long.; and 38° 01.75’N. lat. 122° 55.00’ W. long.; thence westward along the mean high tide line onshore boundary to 38° 01.783’N. lat. 122° 55.286’W. long.; and 38° 01.954’N. lat. 122° 56.451’W. long.\nPoint Reyes SMCA is bounded by straight lines connecting the following points in the order listed except where noted:\n37° 59.00’ N. lat. 123° 02.00’ W. long.; 38° 56.71’ N. lat. 123° 02.00’ W. long.; thence eastward along the three nautical mile offshore boundary to 37° 56.36’ N. lat. 122° 57.34’ W. long.; 37° 59.00’ N. lat. 122° 57.34’ W. long.; and 37° 59.00’ N. lat. 123° 02.00’ W. long.\n\n\n== Habitat and wildlife ==\nThe Point Reyes peninsula hosts 45% of North American bird species and almost 18% of California’s plant species, including 23 threatened and endangered species. At the receiving end of one of California’s major upwelling zones, this coastal habitat is also home to humpback and gray whales, seals, sea lions, and elephant seals. Point Reyes SMR and Point Reyes SMCA protect multiple habitats including exposed high energy rocky shoreline, sand & gravel beaches, offshore islets, surf grass, and soft & hard substrates, and the diverse fish, seabird and marine mammals associated with them.\n\n\n== Recreation and nearby attractions ==\nThrough a haze of salty fog, visitors can see, hear, smell and even feel the thunderous ocean breakers washing over long sandy beaches and crashing into rocky cliffs. Point Reyes National Seashore covers over 100 square miles (260 km2) and includes 33,300 acres of coastal wilderness area. The undeveloped coastline stretches for 80 miles (130 km). Extensive recreational activities include hiking, biking, kayaking, camping and wildlife viewing. There are three visitor centers and extensive ranger-led programs.\nPoint Reyes SMR prohibits the take of all living marine resources. Point Reyes SMCA prohibits the take of all living marine resources, except the recreational and commercial take of Dungeness crab by pot and salmon by trolling. However, California’s marine protected areas encourage recreational and educational uses of the ocean. Activities such as kayaking, diving, snorkeling, and swimming are allowed unless otherwise restricted.\n\n\n== Scientific monitoring ==\nAs specified by the Marine Life Protection Act, select marine protected areas along California’s central coast are being monitored by scientists to track their effectiveness and learn more about ocean health. Similar studies in marine protected areas located off of the Santa Barbara Channel Islands have already detected gradual improvements in fish size and number.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarine Life Protection Act Initiative\nCalOceans\nPoint Reyes National Seashore', 'Emmanuel Brunet-Jailly (1961) is a Canadian politics and public policy scholar at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, where he is Associate Professor, co-director of the Local Government Institute, and director of the European Studies Program. He is editor of the international scholarly publication; Journal of Borderlands Studies (JBS), and executive secretary and treasurer of the international scholarly Association for Borderlands Studies. David Newman is the Chair of the International Editorial Board of JBS.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEmmanuel Brunet-Jailly was born in Paris and raised in the South of France. He holds an LLB from Paul Cézanne University, an MA in Political Science from University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne, and a Ph.D. from the University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada. Michael Keating (political scientist) was chair of his Ph.D. committee. In 1999, he was appointed Assistant Director of the Nanovic Institute for European Studies [5] at the University Of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA. [6] He was hired by the University of Victoria School of Public Administration in 2001 and granted academic tenure in 2007. He became co-director of the Local Government Institute in 2001, Executive Secretary and Treasurer of the Association of Borderland Studies in 2005, and Editor of the Journal of Borderland Studies in 2008 (with Martin van der Velde  and Henk van Houtum ). Since July 2008, he is also director of the University of Victoria European Studies Program, an interdisciplinary teaching and research unit grouping UVic scholars from five of its faculties.\n\n\n== Research ==\nBrunet-Jailly’s published work focuses on two main areas of research:comparative urban governance, and the governance of cross-border regions, with a specific focus on comparative decentralization, horizontal and vertical governance, and the theorization of cross-border regions.\nHis interest in border cities and border urban regions, originates from his work as a civil servant of the French Government Agence Pour la Création d\'Entreprises. [7] While working in the Paris office of APCE he developed a strong interest in what makes cities wealthy or poor, their international relations, and the impact of economic integration on urban politics.\nAs a result, a first strand of research is his notable attempt to make a strong theoretical contribution to the study of urban borderlands. In the 1990s, this literature was underdeveloped, but has seen a resurgence of interests after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington D.C.. One of his goals has been to develop a border model that would allow scholars to compare borders effectively and thus expand the scholarly \'boundaries\' of their respective fields of study.\nA second concurrent strand of research is about urban governance issues. In this area, he has published a number of research papers and a book Local Government in a Global World at the University of Toronto Press, with John Martin. Since 2001, he has written with Warren Magnusson (University of Victoria) the “Municipal Affairs” section of the Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Policies.\nAll in all, as of 2008, his short biography states that his research work has appeared or is forthcoming in eight books or guest edited scholarly journals, and over 38 articles and book chapters in the following refereed journals and presses: Canadian American Public Policy, Canadian Political Science Review, Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs,[8] Geopolitics, International Journal of Economic Development, Journal of Borderland Studies, Journal of Urban Affairs, University of Toronto Press, University Of Ottawa Press, Institute of Public Administration of Canada [9], Rowman and Littlefield (Lanham, MD), Commonwealth Local Government Forum (London, UK London), Hassleholm; Sweden, Queen’s McGill University Press, Septentrion University Press, Lille, France, and Katharla publishers, Paris, France.\n\n\n== Published work ==\nNotable publications on border and borderland issues include:\n"The Canadian American Border" guest-editor of a special number of the Journal of Borderland Studies (2004). 19/1.\n"Theorizing Borders: An Interdisciplinary Perspective” Geopolitics (2005) Vol. 10/4.\n"Border Security" guest-editor of a special number of the Journal of Borderland Studies (2006) 21/1.\n"Rarely Studied Borders and Borderlands" equal guest editor with Donald Alper, Journal of Borderland Studies (2008) 23/3.\n"Cascadia – The Emergence of a North American Border Region" special number of the Canadian Political Science Review equal guest editor with Patrick Smith.

Europeanisation appears at both, national and regional level and is determined by different types of adaptation pressures and "mediating" institutions operating within different actors (bodies) of governance. Europeanisation emphasizes the involvement of local framework, development of more urban partnerships and encouragement of wider level of actors in multilevel territorial interaction.\nGovernance is a process of involvement and coordination between different bodies to work together and address various challenges. Within the governance network the state does not enter anymore as a main "regulator and policy maker" but more often, recently as one of the stakeholders involved in the process. Europeanisation in cities occurs as a consequence of intensive political and economical interactions between actors at every territorial level and it can be distinguished by two different streams:\nDownload Europeanisation – characterised by changes in policies, practices, participants within local systems of governance, arising from the negotiation and implementation of EU programmes,\nUpload Europeanisation – characterised by the transfer of innovative urban practices to the supra-national level, with an outcome of local initiatives in pan-European policies, or programmes.\n\n\n== Europeanisation ==\n\n\n=== History of Europeanisation ===\nThe Italian Renaissance generated a new cultural model, which was promising a modernisation and the European expansion, whilst the European cultural homogeneity should still had been maintained. Therefore, this specification was leading to such an outcome, that all countries on Atlantic coastline specialised mainly in trade, central Europe retained an urban – based commercial landscape, and Eastern Europe an apricultural perception. The early modern period was strongly characterized by contradictory processes of Europeanisation. Lately, the French Revolution contributed to an increase of this domain. Increasing effort to create a number of European institutions had not entirely followed the process of Europeanisation, although recently it is a relatively stable framework for states, as bodies and members of these institutions. The European Union as one of these institutions nowadays represents a modern level and a new quality of Europeanisation influencing the countries within the European Union.\n\n\n=== Europeanisation in British Cities ===\nIn the UK, a significant shift of power to NGOs and private companies determinates the new implementation of policy by these actors. Local government and urban authorities are experiencing a significant decrease of influence and therefore, the public participation’s trust and involvement in decision processes is highly dependent on the cooperation with NGOs and their ability to provide a significant level of awareness. Central cities due to the shift of governance have been cut off from their “suburban hinterlands” and forced to implement narrower policies. With an involvement of New Labour i n 1997, the new urban regeneration programmes have been implemented into local level. Participation in EU Structural Fund programmes, the URBAN Community Initiative and Urban Pilot Projects has significantly contributed to a change of urban governance in the UK. The UK central government’s effort to retain absolute control over the Structural Funding has been determined by encouragement rather than prevention of further Europeanisation at the local level. Increasing level of Europeanisation in the UK has also a further origin in a connection between the central government with local actors, resulted in formation of new implications in terms of urban governance e.g. “european urban governance”. The centralization of local government is apparent in the weight of legislation directed at local authorities. The local authorities in cities such as Birmingham and Glasgow have participated and encouraged direct lobbying, long-term strategic programming and partnership, to liaise with conditions of The European Union Programme and to benefit from Structural Funding in terms of urban development. This process can be described as “following the European strategies” in terms of urban governance. Internalisation of European Commission’s principles of programming occurs as one of the significant elements within urban local authorities when implementing the policy on European level. Both cities have further developed strong transnational networks within Eastern Europe and strong relationship in terms of international cooperation and development programmes. Observation of their development released the evidence about the adaptation pressure arose from EU Structural Funds. The Europeanisation occurs here as an emerging process, thus a “steering regulator”, which the governments of these countries are more likely to follow than to regulate and govern.\n\n\n== EU Cohesion Policy ==\nEU Cohesion Policy is a new reform programme which has been developed to assess and monitor the evaluation of Structural Funds and their outcome in lower developing regions. The new reform became one of the most intensively evaluated policies in Europe. The contributors and assessors are policy makers and researchers from different range of disciplines. EU Cohesion Policy refers to the set of activities aimed to reduction of regional and social disparities in the European Union. Although, the EU Cohesion Policy appears as a relatively well designated programme, there are still some unresolved issues in terms of measurements, philosophical approaches and methods of Cohesion Policy evaluation.\nThe further challenges such as different interests of European institutions and Member State governments occur as a main constraint. Cohesion Policy has been described as “political expression of solidarity” between Europe’s wealthier and poorer regions. In terms of resolving the challenges, the EU Funding should be focused more on specialized areas of support, such as regional innovation networking, financial engineering, environmental sustainability and specialist advisory. The better approach should be made not only in terms of accountability, but on capacity-building and learning objectives. Although, there is a direct influence from political actors to determine the policy, decisions processes, objectives and methods should be made within the partnership programme. The main objective of cohesion policy is to diminish the gap between different regions, more precisely between less-favored regions and affluent ones. It is an instrument of financial solidarity and a powerful force for economic integration.\n\n\n=== Socio-economic disparities in European regions ===\nSocio-economic disparities in the European Union countries are considerable. Strong differences between neighboring regions create both, threats and opportunities. In terms of opportunities we understand goods, capital and labour in relatively closely defined regions; in the threats perspective it is mainly appearance of large differences between wealth and lagging regions. Described threats are highlighting the importance of geographical range (thus influence on socio-economic standards). In terms of economic development, disparities between European countries have been reduced over the last two decades, showing a clear “convergence” between the countries. The imbalances occurred particularly due to a large agglomeration, where geographically advanced regions play a significant role in growing GDP. Although poorer and more peripheral regions of the EU have shown a significant economic growth, in terms of the whole European economy they represent only a smart part of contribution. In rapidly growing economies such as Ireland, Estonia and Latvia regional differences lead to a positive outcome and relative decline in the more peripheral parts. Socio-economic differences due to regional disadvantage occur particularly in Finland, France and Spain, where the high unemployment rate has increased in more peripheral regions. Migration into rapidly growing areas seems in most European countries as an emerging issue.\n\n\n=== Spatial disparities in European Regions ===\nThe increase in intra-national regional disparities is experienced by almost all the EU-27 Member States. Mapping potential accessibility to European GDP makes it possible to identify the areas well positioned to develop “hub functions”, by acting as "businesses and entrepreneurial" crossroad. In the former EU-15 countries the analysis confirms that the main cause of inequality is a dominance of the main metropolitan areas, which are creating two or more imbalanced territories, such as Italy (North-South), Belgium (Flanders-Wallonia), Germany (West-East) and Spain (North-East and South-West). Geometrical coherence is an identifiable quality that ties the city together through form, and is an essential for the vitality of the urban fabric. From the perspective of geographical advantage, a major core area centered in the border regions of Southern Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia emerges as well as a key – centre in terms of accessibility around Prague, Bucharest, Budapest and Vienna.\nFurther disparities between urban and rural regions may have a detrimental impact on the perspectives in terms of sustainable growth and GDP. Infrastructure investments may extend the labor market and decrease structural disadvantages within the country; however, their effectiveness depends on their investment design and main objective. Huge territorial imbalances between metropolitan areas and their surrounding regions are highlighting the strong polarization of the European territory.\n\n\n=== EEA Grants and Norway Grants ===\nThe EEA Grants and Norway Grants are Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway’s contribution to reducing economic and social disparities in European Economic Area and to the strengthening of bilateral relations with the 15 beneficiary states in Central and Southern Europe. All three countries have provided the financial support in terms of social and economic imbalances since 1994 and both grants initiatives were established in connection with the historic enlargement of the European Union and European Economic Area in 2004. Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway agreed on joint management of the EEA Grants and Norway Grants; however, the decision-making procedure regarding the EEA Grants lies in hands of the Financial Mechanism Committee, whereas the Norway Grants are being managed by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The EEA Grants and Norway Grants are administered by the Financial Mechanism Office (FMO) in Brussels. A National Focal Point is the coordinating authority and contact point for each of the beneficiary states. More than one fourth of the EEA Grants was awarded to projects in the fields of environmental protection and sustainable development.\n\n\n== Urban Governance ==\nUrban Governance is a combined effort of multitude actors at a different level of government, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and community. Vertical partnership between national, regional and local governments must be complemented by horizontal partnership of stakeholders within cities. Local authorities and government play significantly important role in land use development, community development and social services. The Urban governance in European countries is characterised by its diversity due to spatial and urban disparities. In cities of southern Europe a high level of centralized decisions is jeopardizing a successful outcome of the policy. Importance of the examination of local level political processes, determined by the local political and social infrastructure is an important tool for successful urban governance.\nThe north European regions’ post-war welfare has been described as a consequence of extensive urban planning policies and centrally defined responsibilities for local authorities, whereas the southern regions interpret a presence of indigenous small and medium-sized firms dominated the organisation of industry. A significantly lower level of urban development appears in the south, while increase in entrepreneurial activities as a “part of urban development” occurs in northern parts. Urban governance in southern European regions is determined by institutional and territorial decentralisation and a week participation in urban development programmes.\nLack of transparency and accountability within governance networks in south European areas increasingly blurs the distinction between the state, NGOs, private companies and public sector. The structure and functions of the governmental organizations are often highly fragmented and therefore, these might be overlapping powers and responsibilities. Secondly, the community response in southern European states is less included in decision-making processes, either in variety of consultations with stakeholders, or in assessments of environmental impacts and management processes. Political will is significantly important for successful process of urban governance, as changing the political environment has a great impact on voluntary and community activity. The more closer is the connection between ‘real communities’ in regions, cities, neighborhoods and government bodies, the more sensitive will be addressing the issues on local and regional level, and more successful the implementation of the policy. Urban governance is hence, not a tool to retain a control over the increasing challenges, but ability to successfully manage and regulate the differences and to be creative in urban areas where the changes are most visible.\n\n\n=== Urban Policy ===\nIn 2007, in European Union, ministers adopted the Leipzig Charter to achieve the objective of sustainable cities and recognise the importance of social, cultural and economic role that cities play.\nThe key policy document is building on the results of the previous presidencies, in particular:\nThe Lille Action Programme (2000),\nThe Urban Acquis (2004)\nThe Bristol Accord (2005).\nEuropean cities (and metropolitan regions) by signing the Leipzig Charter had acceded into conditions to draw up integral development plans, whereas the local authorities had taken responsibility to implement these plans.\nThe Leipzig Charter contains two key policy messages:\nIntegrated urban development should be applied through Europe and, the appropriate framework should be established at national and European level in order to be successful,\nDeprived urban neighbourhoods must increasingly receive political attention within the scope of an integrated urban development policy.\n\n\n== Local governance and NGOs in European regions ==\nNetworks, as today\'s “panacea” for environmental governance occurs as an important driver for implementing certain policies. NGOs are significantly influencing public participation\'s involvement and on the other hand, they step in where, there is a “gap” that governments or companies are unable to fill. Networks are playing an essential role in decision-making processes in terms of consultation to government or industries, regulating activities and sometimes even intervene, when substituting for traditional policies. NGOs can further act on behalf of their members, or as a significant political pressure group in their own right.\nThe most addressing reason for shifting the urban governance into local and institutional networks is economic globalization and global spectacle, thus the emergence of world-wide institutions. Cities as a key element of urban governance due to changes in political, social, spatial spheres and growing complexity of social life are trying to “delink” themselves from their national economies. City governments had to become more entrepreneurial and able to attract a business investments. New lifestyle and social differentiation appears as impossible to govern at one level and the governance response to these circumstances therefore includes new combinations of people-based and place-based policies. Community capacity-building remains a “cornerstone of area committee” and is likely to increase its appearance in the future. Institutional frameworks can influence positively to regional and urban challenges in terms of innovative processes. By institutions, institutionalists we understand rules, norms and practices which structure areas of social endeavour and not formal organisations, which focus on interactions and not decisions. The way of governing has shifted from those of “hierarchies and bureaucracy” to selforganising networks of heterarchy.”  Private firms are seeking more political engagement and want to achieve better functioning of urban and economic system. On the other hand, the state wants to influence firms to achieve better overall economic performance. In the European Union the urban governance at the national scale requires except network influences and financial capital, sufficiency of knowledge for policy makers, otherwise “one solution model suitable to one region” does not necessarily guarantee successful outcome of the policy in the other region. The issue of multilevel governance in cities occurs in such cases when, the local governance activity “can mask the inefficiency” of social and political implementation policies to support and encourage citizens. Another cause of urban governance shift is arising a social justice, greater consciousness of the diversity of basic needs and cultural identities, and a stronger awareness of environmental resource management and sustainability limits.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUrban Governance\nEurope\'s remoter regions\nEarnings disparities in Europe\nQuality of Life in Europe - still many disparities\nEEA Grants and Norway Grants Programme Areas 2009 -2014', 'The Autovía A-7 (also called Autovia del Mediterráneo) is a Spanish autovía (toll-free limited-access highway) which starts in La Jonquera, near the French frontier and ends in Algeciras.

The chosen weapon was a design of the state-owned arsenal Atelier de Puteaux ("Puteaux workshop", abbreviated to APX), and was designated the canon de 47 mm semi-automatique mle 1937. A similar model designated the canon de 47 mm semi-automatique mle 1939 was also produced. Both were efficient weapons, especially given the thin armour of the German tanks of the time. It was capable of piercing 60 mm (2.4 in) at 550 meters (600 yd) or 80 mm (3.1 in) at 180 meters (200 yd). Unfortunately for France, the 47mm SA mle 1937 and 47mm SA mle 1939 were still rare weapons at the time of the Battle of France.\n\n\n== Foreign use ==\nExamples captured by the German forces were operationally used under the designation 4.7 cm Pak 181(f) for the mle 1937 and 4.7 cm Pak 183(f) for the mle 1939. In addition to being used in Atlantic Wall fortifications the Germans also used them to arm a number of their self-propelled tank destroyers.\nPanzerjägers:\n4.7 cm Pak 181(f) oder 183(f) auf PzJäg Lorraine Schlepper(f) - mounted on a French artillery tractor chassis\n4.7 cm Pak(f) auf Panzerspähwagen P204(f) - mounted on a French armored car chassis\n4.7 cm Pak(f) auf PzKpfW I - mounted on a Panzer I chassis\n4.7 cm Pak(f) auf PzKpfW Mk.II 748(e) - mounted on a British Matilda II chassis\n4.7 cm Pak 181(f) oder 183(f) auf PzKpfW 35R(f) - mounted on a French infantry tank chassis\n\n\n== Variants ==\n47mm SA mle 1939 TAZ - a variant on a tripod, capable of 360° traverse, which did not enter production.\n47mm SA mle 1935 - an earlier variant, mounted on tanks such as the Somua S35 and the Char B1\n\n\n== See also ==\n25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun\n47 mm Model 1931 anti-tank gun - a comparable Belgian gun of the same period\n\n\n== References ==\n\nFerrard, Stéphane.

It dissolves in water very well, but it also exists in the pure state, as opposed to chloric acid or bromic acid. Iodic acid contains iodine in the oxidation state +5 and it is one of the most stable oxo-acids of the halogens in its pure state. When iodic acid is carefully heated, it dehydrates to iodine pentoxide. On subsequent heating, the iodine pentoxide further decomposes, giving a mix of iodine, oxygen and lower oxides of iodine.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nIodic acid can be produced by oxidizing I2 with strong oxidizers such as Nitric acid HNO\n3, Chlorine Cl\n2, Chloric acid HClO\n3 or Hydrogen peroxide H\n2O\n2, for example :\nI\n2 + 6 H\n2O + 5 Cl\n2 ⇌ 2 HIO\n3 + 10 HCl.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nIodic acid is a relatively strong acid with a pKa of 0.75. It is strongly oxidizing in acidic solution, less so in basic solution. When iodic acid acts as oxidizer, then the product of the reaction is either iodine, or iodide ion. Under some special conditions (very low pH and high concentration of chloride ion, e.g. in concentrated hydrochloric acid), iodic acid is reduced to iodine trichloride, a golden yellow compound in solution and no further reduction occurs. In the absence of chloride ions, when there is an excess amount of reductant, then all iodate is converted to iodide ion. When there is an excess amount of iodate, then part of the iodate is converted to iodine.It may be used in preparation of ionization to form alkyl halide\n\n\n== Uses ==\nIodic acid is used as a strong acid in analytical chemistry. It may be used to standardize solutions of both weak and strong bases, with methyl red or methyl orange as the indicator.\n\n\n== Use in salt industry ==\nIodic acid can be used to synthesize sodium or potassium iodate for increasing iodine content of salt.\n\n\n== References ==', 'Syakilla Salni Jefry Krisnan (born 21 June 1992) is a Malaysian karateka.

W. Hunter, CSN, commanding the Texas Marine Department, from the Houston Navigation Co.\n\n\n== Military use ==\nThe Bayou City was clad with pressed cotton for protection, armed with artillery and operated by the State of Texas as a gunboat in the Galveston area. Just over a year after its charter, in October 1862, she was taken over by the Confederate States Army.\n\n\n== The Battle of Galveston ==\nOn 1 January 1863, in what would come to be known as the Battle of Galveston, the improvised cotton-clad Bayou City, captained by Henry S. Lubbock the brother of Texas governor Francis Lubbock, served as the flagship of a small fleet under the command of Major Leon Smith which also consisted of the tugboat Neptune and two smaller tenders, who succeeded in an operation to drive superior Union warships out of Galveston Bay.\nAfter a brief contest at sea, the USS Harriet Lane sank the Neptune, and one-half of the two-vessel Confederate fleet was lying on the bottom of the harbor. As the lone surviving Rebel steamer, the Bayou City was outnumbered six-to-one among the armed vessels in the harbor.\nHowever, the Bayou City circled around and made a second run on the USS Harriet Lane. This time, the Confederates hit their target. In short order, the crew of the Bayou City succeeded in storming and overpowering the crew of the Lane. The men from the Bayou City boarded and seized the federal vessel despite the explosion of their own heavy cannon. Ultimately, the attack was a success, with the Harriet Lane captured and another Union vessel, the USS Westfield destroyed.\n\n\n== Continued service ==\nFollowing the Battle of Galveston, Bayou City served the Confederacy in Texas waters until the conclusion of the American Civil War.\n\n\n== Fate of the Steamer ==\nAn advertisement for an Auction Sale in Flake's Daily Galveston Bulletin (Galveston, Galveston Co., TX), Sun., 24 Jun 1866, p. 5, c. 5 - Sale of Government Property - Will be sold on Tuesday, the 12th July, at 10 o'clock a.m. at the corner of Strand and Tremont streets, in the city of Galveston, the following property: Stm'r Bayou City, near Lagrange, Neches river.

He was National Public Prosecutor from October 31, 2005, to February 8, 2007, and Polish Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration from February 8, 2007, to August 8, 2007.\nHe graduated from the Faculty of Law and Administration of the Gdańsk University.\nHis term as interior minister in Jarosław Kaczyński's cabinet ended abruptly when he was dismissed because the accusations of warning Andrzej Lepper about an impending action of the Central Anticorruption Bureau action. Since then Kaczmarek has repeatedly criticized the government, especially Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro.\nOn 30 August 2007 Kaczmarek was detained for 48 hours on allegations of hampering the investigation and submitting false testimonies. Some observers in the Polish press initially regarded this arrest as a political dirty trick intended to silence critics of the Kaczynski government. However, on the press conference on August 31, 2007 prosecutors presented several evidences supporting the charges presented to Kaczmarek.\nOn September 6, 2007, a Warsaw criminal court declared that the August 30 arrest of Kaczmarek was not necessary and irregularly made, although did not undermine the charges against him.\n\n\n== References ==\n(in Polish) 01.09.2007, Kaczmarek skłamał - obejrzyj nagrania z hotelowych kamer, TVN24\n(in Polish) 06.09.2007, Sąd: Zatrzymanie Kaczmarka bezzasadne i nieprawidłowe, TVN24", 'A forlorn hope is a band of soldiers or other combatants chosen to take the leading part in a military operation, such as an assault on a defended position, where the risk of casualties is high.\nSuch a band is also known as the "enfants perdus".\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term comes from the Dutch verloren hoop, literally "lost troop". The term was used in military contexts to denote a troop formation.\nThe Dutch word hoop (in its sense of heap in English) is not cognate with English hope: this is an example of false folk etymology. The mistranslation of verloren hoop as "forlorn hope" is "a quaint misunderstanding" using the nearest-sounding English words. This false etymology is further entrenched by the fact that in Dutch the word hoop is a homograph meaning "hope" as well as "heap", though the two senses have different etymologies.\nWhile the word hoop has many equivalents in English, including \'pile\' and \'accumulation\' perhaps the nearest English translation that most accurately captures the sentiment, at least in military affairs, is lost bunch or lost crowd given the slender expectations of those given such a high-risk assignment.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the German mercenary armies of the Landsknechts, these troops were called the Verlorene Haufen, which has the same meaning as the Dutch term, the word Haufen itself being a general term for a loosely organised group of men. These men carried long double-handed swords, with which they had to hew their way through the massive pike formations opposing them. They also had to withstand the first wave of attacks when defending a breastwork. Members of the Verlorene Haufen earned double pay, thus giving them the name of Doppelsöldner (\'Double-wagers\'), but since there were not enough volunteers, criminals that had been sentenced to death were taken into the ranks as well. As a field sign, the Verlorene Haufen carried a red Blutfahne (\'Blood Banner\').\nBy extension, the term forlorn hope became used for any body of troops placed in a hazardous position, e.g., an exposed outpost, or the defenders of an outwork in advance of the main defensive position. This usage was especially common in accounts of the English Civil War, as well as in the British Army in the Peninsular War of 1808–1814, and in the days of muzzle-loading muskets, the term was most frequently used to refer to the first wave of soldiers attacking a breach in defences during a siege.\nWhile it was likely that most members of the forlorn hope would be killed or wounded the intention was that some would survive long enough to seize a foothold that could be reinforced, or at least that a second wave with better prospects could be sent in while the defenders were reloading or engaged in mopping up the remnants of the first wave. That said such soldiers were rarely suicidal or foolhardy: British troops of the forlorn hope at the 1812 Siege of Badajoz carried a large bag (5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) by 2 feet (0.61 m) in diameter) stuffed with hay or straw, which was thrown down into the enemy trenches to create a cushion and prevent injury as they jumped down.\nA forlorn hope may have been composed of volunteers and conscripted criminals and were frequently led by ambitious junior officers with hopes of personal advancement: if the volunteers survived, and performed courageously, they would be expected to benefit in the form of promotions, cash gifts and adding glory to their name (a military tradition at least as old as the Roman Republic) while the commanding officer himself was virtually guaranteed both a promotion and a long-term boost to his career prospects.\nIn consequence, despite the grave risks involved for all concerned, there was often serious competition for the opportunity to lead such an assault and to display conspicuous valor.\nThe French equivalent of the forlorn hope, called Les Enfants Perdus (\'The Lost Children\'), were all guaranteed promotion to officer rank should they survive, with the effect that both enlisted men and officers joined the dangerous mission as an opportunity to raise themselves in the army.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBanzai charge\nBattle of Sari Bair\nSecond Battle of Fort Wagner\nCannon fodder\nFrontal assault\nKamikaze\nPenal military unit\nShock troops\nSuicide attack\nSuicide mission\n\n\n== References ==']
