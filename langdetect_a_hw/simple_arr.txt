It can be used as a means to identify a person. Since the password is the only way to identify a person, it has to be kept secret. A password can be static. This means it will remain the same unless the user changes it, or it rarely changes. Or a password can be dynamic. A dynamic password changes regularly and does not remain the same. One type of a dynamic password is a one-time pad that can only be used once.\nPasswords were first used in the military. This was to be able to tell who was a friend and who was an enemy when it was dark.\nModern passwords are made of characters, letters and numbers. Sometimes a password will require a minimum number of characters. Usually this is from six to eight. Some websites allow only the use of letters and numbers, but no other characters on the keyboard. Other websites advise using a combination of letters and numbers to increase the "strength" of a password. Websites also advise changing a password once a year or more often to prevent hacking. A person may be able to guess a password if it is too easy. While being typed, each letter of a password is shown as * or •.\nOther ways of verifying the identity of a person include using fingerprint scanners and face detection.', 'The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and part of Papua New Guinea.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first inhabitants of the Archipelago arrived around 33,000 years ago after sailing from what is now Papua New Guinea. Later arrivals included the Lapita people.\nThe first European to visit these islands was Dutch explorer Willem Schouten in 1616.\nThe islands remained unsettled by western Europeans until they became part of the German protectorate of German New Guinea in 1884. The area was named in honor of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck.\nOn 13 March 1888, a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami. Almost 100% of the volcano fell in to the ocean leaving a small lake in the volcanic crater.\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force seized the islands in 1914 and Australia later received a League of Nations mandate for the islands. They remained under Australian control – interrupted only by Japanese occupation during World War II – until Papua New Guinea became independent in 1975.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFirth, Stewart (1983).

Braid saw a demonstration of mesmerism by Charles Lafontaine in 1841 and began to explore and research the subject for himself. He argued that the trance like state that a person went into, which he called hypnotism, was a state of mind. He said it was not caused by the transferring "mesmeric fluid" or "animal magnetism". He believed a hypnotic state could be caused by having a person stare at a small bright object. When a person was in a hypnotic state, they could be given suggestions which they did not remember when fully awake. He also noted changes in pulse and blood circulation, which he believed were able to cure some illnesses. He began using hypnotism and suggestion as way of treating some of his patients.\nBraid wrote a book and several articles about his research and his ideas:\nNeurypnology, or, The Rationale of Nervous Sleep (1843).\nThe Power of the Mind over the Body (1846).\nMagic, Witchcraft, Animal Magnetism, Hypnotism, and Electro-Biology (1852).\nHypnotic Therapeutics, Illustrated by Cases (1853).\nHis ideas were later developed by a group of doctors in Paris, who were called "Braidists".

An extremely small hole in a thin material can create an image when all light rays from a scene go through a single point. In order to produce a reasonably clear image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less. The shutter of a pinhole camera usually consists of a hand operated flap of some light-proof material to cover and uncover the pinhole.\nA common use of a pinhole camera is to capture the movement of sunlight over a long period of time. This type of photography is called Solargraphy. Pinhole cameras require much longer exposure times than conventional cameras because of the small aperture; typical exposure times can range from 5 seconds to hours or days.\nThe image may be projected on a translucent screen for real-time viewing (popular for viewing solar eclipses; see also camera obscura).\n\n\n== Invention of pinhole camera ==\nVery early in history (as far back as 500 B.C.), Greeks such as Aristotle and Euclid wrote on naturally-occurring rudimentary pinhole cameras, for example light may travel through the slits of wicker baskets and the crossing of leaves  The ancient Greeks, however, believed that our eye emitted rays which enabled us to see. What enabled a much better understanding of the pinhole camera was the discovery that light enters the eye rather than leaving it. It was the 10th-century Muslim mathematician, astronomer and physicist Ibn al-Haytham who published this idea.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Other websites ==\nWorldwide Pinhole Photography Day website\nPinhole Photography and Camera Design Calculators\nIllustrated history of cinematography\nHistory and Pinhole Photography Resources', 'Saeed Al-Owairan (born 19 August 1967) is a former Saudi Arabian football player.

The law made by the European Court, the reason the reason a worker wanted to move abroad does not matter, they could start part-time and full-time work, and get extra help from the new country.\nOther decisions of the ECJ allowed any citizen of a member country live anywhere in the EU and be treated the same as a citizen of the new country.\n\n\n== Start of EU Citizenship ==\nThe idea of EU citizenship was started by the Maastricht Treaty, and was extended by the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Treaty of Amsterdam said that union citizenship will not replace national citizenship, but only be extra it.\n\n\n== Who is an EU citizen? ==\nArticle 17 (1) of the amended EC Treaty states that\n\nCitizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall complement and not replace national citizenship.\n\n\n== Rights of EU citizens ==\n\n\n=== Specific rights ===\nThe amended EC Treaty provides the following rights to EU citizens:\nThe right to be treated the same as citizens of the country where they live. (Article 12);\nThe right to move and live anywhere in the EU, and to apply for any job. EU citizens have the right to work for the government too, but not for some jobs in areas like defence and national security. (Article 18);\nThe rights to vote or be a candidate in local and European elections in any Member State under the same conditions as the nationals of that state (Article 19);\nthe right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any EU country when in a non-EU Member Country, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen\'s own country (Article 20);\nThe right to ask for help from the European Parliament, or from the European Ombudsman if any EU body has acted badly. (Article 21);\nThe right to contact the EU bodies in one of the official languages and to get a reply in that same language (Article 21); and\nThe right to get European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (Article 255).\nCitizens of new countries which join the EU can have some of the rights limited for up to seven years after they join.\n\n\n== Other pages ==\nTreaty of Lisbon\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMaas, Willem (2007).

From the 14th century it was under the control of the city of Florence and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until the unification of Italy in 1860. In the 20th century it became an important industrial town. During World War II it was bombed by Allied aircraft.

These are the "true" gophers. Several ground squirrels of the family Sciuridae are often called gophers as well. They are not true gophers,though. The name "pocket gopher" on its own is used for a number of subspecies of the family. Pocket gophers, despite being largely a pest, are a symbol of the U.S. state of Minnesota, sometimes called "the Gopher State".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nPocket gophers are widely distributed in North America, extending into Central America.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nGophers are heavily built, and most are moderately large. They usually weigh a few hundred grams. A few species reach weights approaching 1 kg. Most gophers have brown fur which often closely matches the color of the soil in which they live. Their most characteristic feature is their large cheek pouches. The pocket in their name comes from these pouches. These pouches are fur-lined, and can be turned inside out. They extend from the side of the mouth well back onto the shoulders. They have small eyes and a short, hairy tail which they use to feel around tunnels when they walk backwards.\n\n\n== Behavior ==\nAll pocket gophers are burrowers. They are larder hoarders, and their cheek pouches are used for transporting food back to their burrows. Gophers can collect large hoards. Their presence is unambiguously announced by the appearance of mounds of fresh dirt about 20 cm in diameter. These mounds will often appear in vegetable gardens, lawns, or farms, as gophers like moist soil. They also enjoy feeding on vegetables. For this reason, some species are considered agricultural pests. They may also damage trees in forests. Although they will attempt to flee when threatened, they may attack other animals, including cats and humans, and can inflict serious bites with their long, sharp teeth.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThere has been much debate among taxonomists about which races of pocket gopher should be recognised as full species.

For example, a bowling ball (large mass) pushed very slowly (low velocity) can hit a glass door and not break it, while a baseball (small mass) can be thrown fast (high velocity) and break the same window. The baseball has a larger momentum than the bowling ball. Because momentum is the product of the mass and the velocity of an object, that both mass and velocity affect the momentum of an object. As shown, an object with a large mass and low velocity can have the same momentum as an object with a small mass and large velocity. A bullet is another example where the momentum is very-very high, due to the extraordinary velocity. Another beautiful example where very low-velocities cause greater momentum is the push of Indian subcontinent towards the rest of Asia, causing serious damages, such as earth quakes in the portions of himalayas. In this example, the subcontinent is moving as slow as few inches per year but the mass (imagine weight of India) of Indian-subcontinent is very high.\nAs defined by Newton, momentum of an object (p) is the product of the mass (m) and velocity (v) of the object. It is a vector quantity, which has both direction and magnitude. Its unit is kg m/s (kilogram metre per second) or N s (newton second). Momentum is sometimes referred to as linear momentum which is different from its related subject angular momentum.\nMomentum is a conserved object, meaning that the total initial momentum of a system must be equal to the total final momentum of a system. Total amount of momentum remains unchanged.\n\n\n== Formula ==\nIn Newtonian physics, the usual symbol for momentum is the letter p ; so this can be written\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n        \n        =\n        m\n        \n          v\n        \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {p} =m\\mathbf {v} \\,,}\n  \nwhere p is the momentum, m is the mass and v is the velocity\nIf we apply Newton\'s 2nd Law, we can derive\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              m\n              \n                v\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              −\n              m\n              \n                v\n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n            \n               \n              \n                \n                  t\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                −\n                \n                  t\n                  \n                    1\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} ={mv_{2}-mv_{1} \\over \\ {t_{2}-t_{1}}}\\,,}\n  \nThe meaning is that the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change in momentum of the object.\nIn order to use this equation in special relativity, m has to change with speed. That is sometimes called the "relativistic mass" of the object. (Scientists who work with special relativity use other equations instead.)\n\n\n== Impulse ==\nImpulse is the change in momentum caused by a new force: this force will increase or decrease the momentum depending on the direction of the force; towards or away from the object that was moving before. If the new force (N) is going in the direction of the momentum of the object (x), the momentum of x will increase; therefore if N is going towards object x in the opposite direction, x will slow down and its momentum will decrease.\n\n\n== Law of conservation of momentum ==\nIn understanding conservation of momentum, the direction of the momentum is important. Momentum in a system is added up using vector addition. Under the rules of vector addition, adding a certain amount of momentum together with the same amount of momentum going in the opposite direction gives a total momentum of zero.\nFor instance, when a gun is fired, a small mass (the bullet) moves at a high speed in one direction. A larger mass (the gun) moves in the opposite direction at a much slower speed. The momentum of the bullet and the momentum of the gun are exactly equal in size but opposite in direction. Using vector addition to add the momentum of the bullet to the momentum of the gun (equal in size but opposite in direction) gives a total system momentum of zero. The momentum of the gun-bullet system has been conserved.\nA collision also shows conservation of momentum: if a car (1000 kg) is going right at 8 m/s, and a truck (6000 kg) is going left at 2 m/s, the car and truck will be moving left after the collision. This exercise shows why:\nMomentum = Mass x Velocity\nThe car\'s momentum: 1000 kg x 8 m/s = 8000kgm/s (Going right)\nThe truck\'s momentum: 6000 kg x -2 m/s = -12000kgm/s (Going left)\nThis means their total momentum is -4000kgm/s.

The land was originally underwater. The first World Trade Center complex of buildings stood on the site until it was destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The new World Trade Center complex is currently being built on the site. The site is overseen by Studio Daniel Libeskind, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.\n\n\n== September 11 attacks ==\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, two airplanes were captured by terrorists close to al-Qaeda and crashed into the Twin Towers, the North Tower and the South Tower, of the World Trade Center. The towers fell and were destroyed within two hours of the crashes. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks. After the attacks, hospital workers and police offers began calling the site "Ground Zero".\n\n\n== Debris and clean-up ==\nWhen the towers fell, they caused dust to spread in New York City, and left hundreds of thousands of tons of debris at the site. The New York City Fire Department separated the site into four areas to make cleanup of the site and the search for people who survived the attack easier. Early on, it was said that the debris at the site would take a year to get rid of, but cleanup ended in May 2002. Building materials and debris from Ground Zero were sent to the Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island.\nIn December 2001, a viewing area at Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, was opened to the public.\nOn March 11, 2002, six months after the attacks, the Tribute in Light, a memorial with two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky, began. It was lit up every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, it was lit up for the second anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2003. It has been lit up every September 11 since then.\n\n\n== New buildings ==\n\nThe new World Trade Center complex will have the following buildings:\n1 World Trade Center - Construction began in April 2006. It was topped out in August 2012, and should be completed by the spring of 2014.\n2 World Trade Center - Construction began in July 2008.\n3 World Trade Center - Construction began in March 2008.\n4 World Trade Center - Construction began in 2008. It opened on November 13, 2013.\n5 World Trade Center - Construction began on September 9, 2011.\n7 World Trade Center - Opened on May 23, 2006.\nSoon after the September 11 attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor George Pataki, and President George W. Bush said that they would rebuild the World Trade Center. On the day of the attacks, Giuliani said, "We will rebuild. We\'re going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again." During a visit to the site on September 14, 2001, Bush spoke to a crowd of workers through a megaphone. A person in the crowd shouted, "I can\'t hear you," to which Bush replied, "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."\nIn an address to Congress, the president said, "As a symbol of America\'s resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City." However, 12 years after the attacks, only two buildings, 4 World Trade Center and 7 World Trade Center, have been rebuilt. One building, One World Trade Center, is currently under construction.\nIn November 2001, Governor Pataki started the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) to oversee the rebuilding of the World Trade Center. The LMDC leads federal help in the rebuilding, and works with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Larry Silverstein, and Studio Daniel Libeskind. It also communicates with the local community, businesses, the city of New York, and the families of the people who were killed in the September 11 attacks.\n\n\n=== Memorial ===\nA memorial, "Reflecting Absence", honors the people killed in the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. It was designed by Peter Walker and Israeli-American architect Michael Arad. It has a field of trees with the footprints of the original towers. The footprints are filled with pools of water. It opened on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2011.\n\n\n=== Museum ===\nOn October 12, 2004, the LMDC announced that Gehry Partners LLP and Snøhetta, an architectural company from Norway, would design a performing arts center and museum at the site. The museum will act as a memorial museum and a visitors\' center for the site. The museum will open in the spring of 2014.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nAn episode of CBS\'s 60 Minutes in 2010 was about the lack of work done at Ground Zero. It focused on how most of the buildings did not have a date for completion, the main building, One World Trade Center (originally called the Freedom Tower), having gone through three different designs, and the delays and high amount of money that went into the rebuilding. Larry Silverstein said that the entire site would be completed in 2037, and that billions of dollars have been spent on rebuilding the site, even though Ground Zero "is still a hole in the ground." During an interview for the episode, Silverstein said, "I am the most frustrated person in the world...I\'m seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime". However, it was said in early 2011 that a lot of work has been done on the site, with all five buildings under construction. All of the buildings will be completed between 2012 and 2016. Criticism of the work being done at Ground Zero was made in 2008 and 2009, when there was no work being done at the site.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other websites ==\nOfficial site - Silverstein Properties\n9/11 Tribute Center\nReviving Ground Zero - slideshow with audio by The New York Times\nNational September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center\nProject Rebirth\nWorld Trade Center Rising\nRebuildGroundZero.org, a community project based on Ground Zero\'s rebuilding', 'Shinsuke Shiotani (born 11 May 1970) is a former Japanese football player.\n\n\n== Club career statistics ==\n\n\n== References ==', 'Julio César Baldivieso (born 2 December 1971) is a former Bolivian football player.

It is sometimes called timber wolf. A recent study found that the domestic dog is descended from wolves tamed less than 16,300 years ago south of the Yangtze River in China.\nThere are many different wolf subspecies, such as the Arctic wolf. Some subspecies are listed on the endangered species list, but overall, Canis lupus is IUCN graded as \'least concern\'.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nAdult wolves are usually 1.4 to 1.8 metres (4.6 to 5.9 ft) in length from nose to tail depending on the subspecies. Wolves living in the far north tend to be larger than those living further south. As adults they may weigh typically between 23 to 50 kilograms (51 to 110 lb). The heaviest wolf recorded weighed 86 kilograms (190 lb).\nWolves usually measure 26–38 inches at the shoulder. Wolves have fur made up of two layers. The top layer is resistant to dirt, and the underlayer is water resistant. The color of their fur can be any combination of grey, white, red, brown, and black. Studies have shown that in 2007 they have found 23 red gray wolves.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWolves live in groups called "packs". They are pack hunters. The members of the pack are usually family members, often just the parents and offspring. Wolves that are not family may join if they do not have a pack of their own. Packs are usually up to 12 wolves, but they can be as small as two or as large as 25. The leaders are called the parent (breeding) male and the parent (breeding) female. Their territory is marked by scent and howling; they will fight any intruders. Young wolves are called \'pups\' or \'whelps\'. Adult females usually give birth to five or six pups in a litter.\nWolves make a noise called a howl. They howl to communicate with each other from long distances and to mark the edges of their territory. Wolves have a complicated body language.\nWolves can run very fast and far. A wolf can run 20-30 miles in a day.\nGrey wolves can live six to eight years. They can live in captivity for up to 17 years.\n\n\n=== Diet ===\nWolves are carnivores and eat mostly medium to large size hoofed animals (ungulates), but they will also eat rodents, insectivores and foxes. Some wolves have been seen eating salmon, seals, beached whales, lizards, snakes and birds. They also eat moose, bison, deer and other large animals. Wolves usually stalk old or sick animals, but they do not always catch what they stalk. They may go days without food. Sometimes only one out of twelve hunts are successful. But the way they eat stays the same. The alpha male and female feed first. Then the other members feed. Sometimes (especially if the prey they have killed is large) wolves may store food and come back that day to feed on it. Wolves have very sharp teeth which helps them tear large chunks of meat from a dead animal. They will eat up to 2/7 their body weight. Wolves will also swallow food and then bring it back up for pups to eat.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\n\nWolves are found in Europe, Asia and North America. They can live in forests, deserts, mountains, tundra, grasslands and sometimes around towns and cities.\n\n\n== Arctic wolf ==\nThe Arctic wolf may be a subspecies of the grey wolf. They live in the Canadian part of the Arctic circle, as well as Greenland and Iceland.\nThe habitat of Arctic wolves is very hostile. Not much is known about their lifestyle. They are more friendly than other wolves, but they can still be very aggressive.\nArctic wolves are very fluffy. They are smaller than other wolves. Since about 1930, the skull of many Arctic wolves has become smaller. This might be because of hybridization between wolves and dogs. They are 3 feet (0.91 m) tall when they\'re adults. Adult arctic wolves weigh about 75 to 120 pounds (34 to 54 kg). Arctic wolves live in a group of 7-20 wolves. They live up to 5-10 years when they\'re in the wild. They can live for 14 years if they are well cared for in a zoo.\n\n\n== Wolves and humans ==\n\nEven though many people think that wolves are terrible, mean creatures, they are actually much gentler than many people imagine. The main reason wolves become violent is because they may be sick or to protect other wolves in the pack. Many people around the world, especially in Canada and Alaska, have huskies for pets: they are a close relative of the wolf.\nA few years ago wolves were put back into Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to breed, because they were becoming endangered. The wolves have been very successful in the park. There had been no wolves there for a long time, because of hunting and poisoned water. Many people were not happy about this because they were afraid that the wolves would eat the sheep and cows near the park. However, wolves only eat livestock when they can not find wild prey.\n\n\n== Extinction in Britain ==\nWolves in Britain were all killed after centuries of hunting. The last wolves survived in the Scottish Highlands. There is a legend that the last one was killed there in 1743 by a character called MacQueen.\nWithin the past ten years, there have been studies that are in favour of allowing new wolves to come and live in the English countryside and Scottish Highlands again. One study was in 2007. Researchers from Norway, Britain, and Imperial College London decided that wolves would help add back plants and birds that now are eaten by deer. The wolves would keep the deer population lower. People were generally positive, but farmers living in rural areas wanted to be paid for livestock that were killed by the wolves.\n\n\n== In culture ==\nMany folktales such as Little Red Riding Hood have wolves in them.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other websites ==\n Media related to Canis lupus at Wikimedia Commons', "Caffeine is a drug (or chemical) found in plants. It can be harmful for both humans and animals if a large amount is consumed. If a person ate 10-13 grams of caffeine quickly, between 80-100 cups of coffee, it would kill them.\n\n\n== Where caffeine is from ==\nCaffeine is the main drug that is in coffee. Coffee comes from a tree. The seeds of the tree are roasted to make coffee.\nCaffeine comes from other plants as well. It is in guarana, yerba maté, cacao, and some plants used to make tea. The plants use caffeine as a pesticide. This is a chemical that kills insects if they eat the plant. It is the way the plant protects itself.\nIt is called guaranine when it comes from the guarana plant and theine when it comes from a tea plant. It is called mateine in the mate drink. This drink is an infusion made with Yerba mate.\n\n\n== What caffeine is ==\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant drug. A stimulant is a drug that increases body actions like heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism. It makes a person more awake and alert.\nCaffeine also is a diuretic. This means it makes a person make more urine (the waste liquid a person makes).\nThe caffeine chemical is called a xanthine alkaloid. This is a group of chemicals that are stimulants. Some xanthine alkaloids (like theophylline) are used to help asthma.\n\n\n== What caffeine is used for ==\nThe biggest use of caffeine is as a stimulant. People drink coffee and other drinks with caffeine to stay awake\nDoctors sometimes use caffeine as a medicine. It is used for headaches (head pain). It is sometimes used to help premature (born very early) babies to breathe. The short-term risk of this treatment seems to be that the babies treated gain less weight than usual.\nCaffeine is sometimes given to people after a lumbar puncture. This is a test to see if someone has meningitis.'''\nIn the beginning caffeine was found to relieve hunger, so it was used for weight loss. That did not last because people were using too much. Caffeine can be a very dangerous drug when not used in the right way.\nCaffeine also has medicinal properties. It is used in many over the counter medicines, such as Excedrin, Midol and Anacin. When combined with other analgesics, caffeine can help to alleviate headaches and cramps.\n\n\n== Problems with caffeine, ==\n\nThe largest problem with caffeine is addiction. This is when people get bad symptoms when they do not have the drug. When people have withdrawal (feel bad because they do not have the drug) they drink more. This makes them feel better. But if they cannot get more, they are likely to feel some of the symptoms listed below:\nHeadaches\nBeing tired or need to sleep\nFeeling irritable\nNausea (feeling like vomiting)\nCaffeine can also hurt people if they drink a lot at once. If someone takes too much of a drug at once it is called an overdose. Caffeine overdose is a medical diagnosis. It is called:Caffeine-Induced Organic Mental Disorder or Caffeine Intoxication.

That is as much caffeine that is in three cups of coffee (8oz each cup). More than 750–1000 mg a day is a significant amount, but is very unlikely to kill someone. The Lethal Dose 50 of caffeine is 192 mg per kilogram, in rats. In humans, it is between 150 and 200 mg per kilogram (70-90 per pound.)\nCaffeine is in many drinks and foods. This is approximate amounts of caffeine in some food and drink:\nBrewed coffee - 40 to 220 mg in a cup\nInstant coffee - 30 to 120 mg in a cup\nDecaffeinated coffee (with most caffeine taken out) - 3 to 5 mg in a cup\nTea - 20 to 110 mg in a cup\nSoda drinks with caffeine - 36 to 90 mg in 12 ounces. Some people think that soft drinks which are light in color do not contain caffeine. This is not always true.\nMilk chocolate - 3 to 6 mg in an ounce\nBittersweet chocolate - 25 mg in an ounce\nOne ounce – abbreviated oz - is 30ml.\nA 'cup' is 8 oz (240ml.)\n\n\n== Different ways to get 200mg of caffeine ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other websites ==\n\n\n=== Scientific information ===\neMedicine Caffeine-Related Psychiatric Disorders\nThe Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs, Caffeine-Part 1 Part 2\nThe Physician and Sportsmedicine: Caffeine: A User's Guide\nCaffeine: Psychological Effects, Use & Abuse\nCaffeine Withdrawal Recognized as a Disorder\nIs Caffeine a Health Hazard?\n\n\n=== Others ===\nCaffeine Withdrawal Symptoms\nThe Effects Of Caffeine Addiction\nCaffeine: How Stuff Works\nNational Geographic January 2005\nErowid Caffeine Vaults\n#caffeine! - The Caffeine Information Archive\nNaked Scientists Online: Why do plants make caffeine?\nAlcohol and Drugs History Society: Caffeine news page\nCoffee: A Little Really Does Go a Long Way, NPR, September 28, 2006\nDoes coffee really give you a buzz? by John Triggs in the Daily Express April 17 2007\n\n\n=== News ===\nNational Post: Caffeine linked to psychiatric disorders", 'Klara Church (Swedish: Klara kyrka) is a Swedish Evangelical Mission church building in Stockholm, Sweden.

The rifle in the picture above is a bolt action. Some rifles are semi-automatics, where a bullet is loaded (automatically) and fired each time the trigger is pulled. Some are fully automatic, which work like semi-automatics but allow the shooter to fire more than one bullet at a time by holding down the trigger.

The bluestone building was the first large prison built in Victoria. It was the location of many executions, including Ned Kelly who was hanged at the prison in 1880. It closed in 1929 and is now a museum.\nMelbourne was first settled in 1835 and its first small gaol was built in 1839. A second gaol was built in 1841 next to the Supreme Court buildings. In 1852 work started on a new gaol based on the Pentonville Model Prison design. This had its own outside wall of solid bluestone. A second stage started in 1857, and the wall was extended in 1859. In 1860 the north wing, chapel, central hall and entrance was built. A western wing for female prisoners was started in 1862, and the outside wall was finished in 1864. There were also 17 jailer's houses, a chief warden's house and a hospital. It was built on a high point at the edge of the city. However a report in 1870 said the gaol should be closed and the prisoners moved to a more suitable location. The prison finally closed in 1929.\nDuring World War II, the gaol was used as a military prison for Australian soldiers. After the war it became a storage building for the Victoria Police. Some of the buildings were pulled down to allow for the building of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, now Victoria University. In 1972 the buildings were taken over by the National Trust as a museum.\n\n\n== References ==", 'WWE 2K14 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke\'s & Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports.\nThe game was released on October 29, 2013 in North America, October 30, 2013 in Japan and November 1, 2013 in both Europe and India.

The agreement was signed by U.S. President George H.W. Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas on December 17, 1992 in San Antonio, Texas, and took effect on January 1, 1994. It removed taxes on products traded between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It also protects copyrights, patents, and trademarks between those three countries. It was updated with the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, which helped set more environment regulations and helped reduce pollution. It was also updated with the North American Agreement for Labor Cooperation, which helped people fight for better work conditions.\n\n\n== Effects ==\nSince it took away taxes between products traded between the US, Canada, and Mexico, Mexico has been buying more products from the US. It saved U.S. companies on the cost of selling products to Mexico, and it saved Mexican companies on the cost of buying things from U.S. companies.\nA benefit of the bill is that labels on products exchanged between the three countries come in French, English, and Spanish. That way, Mexicans and Americans who speak Spanish can read the Spanish label, Americans and Canadians can read the English label, and Canadians who speak French can read the French label.\nNAFTA also encourages more immigration from Mexico to the US. Since small businesses can no longer be protected by tariffs, many small business owners in Mexico cannot compete with the prices of subsidized products from the US and therefore many of them have gone under, or they lost more money than they could make. As a result, many Mexicans have gone to the US looking for work. The human rights organization EZLN (Ejército Zapatista de la Liberación Nacional), a revolutionary Mexican grass roots movement, is a strong opponent of NAFTA and points out how its provisions only make the economic situation worse for the poorest in Mexico and better for multi-national corporations.\n\n\n== Job losses ==\nSmall Business Chronicle\nWith the increased ease by which Mexico can import food products from the United States, the role of Mexican farmers is overwhelmed by the output of American farming. This is a notable con of NAFTA. According to Thomas Net Industry Market Trends, over 1 million Mexican farmers have lost their jobs as a result of the agreement.\nThe American economy lost about 683,000 jobs thanks to NAFTA -- more than 60% of which were in the manufacturing sector. Almost 35,000 Ohioans found themselves unemployed, or without jobs, thanks to a free trade agreement that’s been a disaster for our nation’s industrial base. - Sharrod Brown\n\n\n== Immigration ==\nIt was possible that NAFTA would encourage Mexican citizens to stay in their country since their manufacturing work could still reach the American market easily. But since the creation of NAFTA, illegal immigration between Mexico and the United States has only gotten worse. Over the 10-year period between 1990 and 2000, the number of illegal immigrants per year doubled, or increased two times, despite the creation of NAFTA in 1994, according to Thomas Net Industry Market Trends. NAFTA not being more effective in preventing the immigration crisis is a disadvantage to the agreement.', 'Lawrence Douglas Lamb (born 10 October 1947) is a British actor.

It is a combination of biology and cognitive psychology. These psychologists study human behavior and knowledge. This is a growing subject that is used more and more everyday. Unlike cognitive neuroscience, cognitive neuropsychology pays attention to the mind rather than the brain.\nMany scientists have worked to make cognitive neuropsychology. Their findings have created an understanding of the brain and how humans learn and do things. Most of these scientists were not psychologists, but are known for their contributions to psychology. The technology today also helps advance what is known. With brain imaging and other methods the brain can now be visualized. Cognitive neuroscience can also be broken into different topics such as memory, attention, language, and emotion.\n\n\n== Beginnings ==\nThe early history of cognitive neuropsychology begins with humans’ first acknowledgement of the mind/brain. Beliefs in the importance of the mind/brain/head emerge as early as 4000BC with the Sumerians. Records of Sumerian intake of the poppy plant (which contains opium) include descriptions of the mind-altering affects upon ingestion. This suggests a reference to the brain. Another clue pointing towards acknowledgement of the brain is the discovery of skulls with holes drilled into them in 2000BC. Discovery of these skulls points to cultural acknowledgement of the brain as important to life. The motivation behind these drillings could vary from spiritual to medical.\nThe greatest contribution to early cognitive neuropsychology came from Egypt in 1700BC. This marks the development of the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus. This document included the first written description of the human brain. These writings include descriptions of meninges and cerebrospinal fluid. The next development emerged from ancient Greece from philosophers Aristotle, Plato and Almaceon. The ancient Greeks hypothesized the form and function of the mind, psyche and soul. Aristotle’s theory focused on the heart as the seat of the mind. He saw the heart containing all emotion and thinking. He also thought that the brain functioned to cool the heart down. Unlike Aristotle, Plato believed the brain to be the locale for mental processes. With Aristotle we see the emergence of the dualistic view of mind and body. The dualistic versus monistic approach to the mind and brain is a debate dominating much of the history of cognitive neuroscience.\nThe developments in cognitive neuropsychology following this time were few and far between due to Church credence against human dissection. This limited the uncovering of new information. At this time we see a noteworthy development by Galen. Galen was a Roman physician whose surgical descriptions of neurology helped describe the anatomy of the brain and neurological disorders. Many unskilled physicians attempted dissections in secret, but with no real, scientific discoveries occurring. .\n\n\n=== 16th Century ===\nBy the middle of the 16th century, there was an increase in cognitive neuropsychology development. This happened after the lull caused by the Church. During The Renaissance cognitive neuropsychology gains many noteworthy contributions. These contributions involve a deeper understanding of the brain and its subsections. We see Vesalius’ publication of the first neuroscience textbook in 1543 and his description of the hydrocephalus in 1550. We also see the first use of the term “hippocampus” in 1564. This is when the brain was starting to be seen as a complex organ responsible for many operations of the body.\nTowards the end of the 1500s a French philosopher and mathematician by the name of René Descartes was born. He was the most well known figure in cognitive neuropsychology at this time. Some of Descartes’ contributions stemmed from his interest in the nervous system and brain’s role in behavior. He posited that the nervous system was made up of hollow tubes which filled with “animal spirits” any time an action were to take place in that part of the body. His other contributions included the more developed notion of dualism. He hypothesized that the brain and mind are two separate entities that exist on their own but are interdependent on each other. He theorized that the pineal gland in the brain is where these two separate entities interacted. Descartes’ dualistic theory serves as his most influential contribution to cognitive neuropsychology.\n\n\n=== 18th Century ===\nDuring the 18th Century science began to be big in the history of cognitive neuropsychology. The first big advance was in human reflexes. These bodily reactions to stimuli or outside forces are observed and measured. This was found by studying axons and learning how signals travel in the human body. Before this, science and technology were not advanced enough, but the 17th Century changed this. In fact, the development of the microscope helped as well. The brain's nerve fibers could now be seen and described. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also found in the spaces of the brain and spinal cord. With that, the physiology of psychology began to take control of cognition. These findings are all still true today.\nAnother advance occurred with electroconvulsion therapy (ECT) or electric shock therapy. This was a method used to treat mental disorders. ECT causes electricity to shock a person's brain. This stimulates all of the brain causing mental disorders to go away and be cured. This was used to treat blindness, hysteria, depression, and many other disorders. It was thought to be the way of the future in treating disabilities.\n\n\n== History of cognitive neuropsychology ==\n\n\n=== 19th Century ===\nThe 19th century started the argument of localism vs. holism in cognitive neuropsychology. People were starting to question holism and explore the idea of localism. Localism means that the brain has individual areas that are responsible for certain actions in the body. The study of Phrenology started these localization theories. Phrenology is looking at the human skull and finding strange bumps to be measured. Any strange bumps or shapes in the skull were then paired with intelligence or self traits in a person. These traits could include language, logic, and even love. If a part of the skull was pushed out it would mean that trait was better. This started localization theories \nThe next big thing in cognitive neuroscience has to do with ablation studies. This is when parts of the brain were removed so function could be measured without this brain area. For example, a neuropsychologist can remove the cerebellum. After it is removed, the animal's balance was not good. This links the cerebellum to balance. As for brain damage, the most famous case is with Phineas Gage. This patient was working on the railroad when a piece of metal went through the front of his head. He did not die from this brain injury. However, his normal personality changed. This brought the idea that the frontal cortex, the part of the brain that was stabbed, controlled how a person acted. Another study found the localization of language in the brain. Two separate scientists studied patients with language problems. They found that their patients all had lesions or damage in two certain areas of their brain. One area known as Broca's area controlled talking. The other area Wernicke's area was found to control understanding of language.\nThis way of looking at problems in the brain lead to studies of epileptic patients. An epileptic patient is a person that frequently suffers from seizures. These seizures were studied to learn more about how the brain sends electrical signals. These electrical signals were then measured. It was found that each neuron can send a signal at certain speeds. These neurons were then dyed with a stain in order to be seen. At first it was thought that all nerves were connected like a web called a nerve net. However, with more complex stain it was found that each nerve is separate and can fire on their own.\n\n\n=== 20th Century ===\nIn the early part of the 20th century, there was a long time that cognitive neuropsychology was not studied. This was partly because of the influence of John B. Watson, who was a behaviorist in psychology. He argued that cognition could not be studied scientifically because it could not be observed. So for the first half of the 20th century, psychology as a field was dominated by behaviorism, which was mainly stimuli and a person’s response to it. John B. Watson was only one psychologist to criticize cognitive psychology. Pierre Marie in 1906 criticized Broca, who was one of the first to create the field of Cognitive Neuropsychology. Henry Head in 1926 also attacked the whole field of cognitive neuropsychology. Due to these criticisms, and the influence of behaviorism, cognitive neuropsychology was dormant for many years.\nAnother reason why cognitive neuropsychology disappeared in the early twentieth century was because the science was not yet advanced enough. Many cognitive psychologists were also neurologists. These two fields of study were not separate yet, as they are today. These neurologists wanted to study modules in the brain, and localize them with parts of the brain, but technology did not allow this yet. The methods used today were not yet created. They could only study where a person’s brain lesion was by doing an autopsy after the person was already dead. This was a lot of the reason this field was criticized against, and why many people believed cognition could not be studied scientifically.\nIn the middle of the twentieth century there was a transition called the 'Cognitive Revolution' in psychology. This is when psychologists began to agree that there were scientific ways to study cognition. These new beliefs about cognitive psychology were brought on by John C. Marshall's and Nora Newcombe’s study of reading, and Shallice and Warrington’s study of memory in the early 1970s. In the mid 1980s the first undergraduate book was published by Ellis & Young named Human Cognitive Neuropsychology. There was also an emergence of new technology that made it easier to study the brain and the mind. The 1970s and 1980s was the time period that cognitive neuropsychology became visible, and many psychologists started studying it after.\nAn important feature of the later half of the twentieth century was the clear separation of cognitive neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive neuropsychologists study the human mind after brain damage has occurred, and focus more on cognition. Cognitive neuroscientists study the human brain and neural systems after brain damage has occurred, and focus more attention on the neurons. While the cognitive neuroscientists are concerned with how the brain works, and what parts of the brain is responsible for what functions, cognitive neuropsychologists want to study people with brain damage to try and see how the human mind works. With this information, they can formulate theories about the human mind, and also make better therapies for people with brain damage.\nAn important feature that was developed in the twentieth century is the way that research is conducted. Since every single person’s brain damage is different, cognitive neuropsychologists study only single cases instead of groups of people, or syndromes. Psychologists study the mind by looking at people who lost some sort of function after brain damage occurred. For example, if a person could recognize both faces and objects before brain damage occurred, but then after brain damage in a certain part of the brain they could only recognize faces and not objects, then psychologists can make inferences about the functions in certain modules of the brain.\nThe late 20th century was also when they began using computational models of cognition. The psychologists would make theories and install them into a computer, then virtually damage the fake brain where the patient had damage. By doing this, they can get a better look at how the mind works. This is one way that technology has helped in studying the human mind. This, along with the invention of the devices to scan the brain, has made a big difference in cognitive neuropsychology.\nCognitive neuropsychologists use the method of double dissociation when studying the modules of the mind. This is when they use many patients who have had brain damage and try to figure out which parts of the brain are responsible for different cognition. This concept of modularity was developed by Jerry Fodor in his 1983 book The Modularity of the Mind. Psychologists disagree as to how much and which parts of the mind is constructed modules.\n\n\n=== 21st Century ===\nIn this century, cognitive neuropsychologists use many methods to study the mind. They use machines that scan the brain to see where the damage is, and then study cognitive abilities of these patients. They still use double dissociation for studying the patients, case studies, computational models, and many other features that were invented in the late twentieth century. With new technology, there is likely to be a lot of improvement in this field.\n\n\n== Important people ==\nThese people all contributed to cognitive neuroscience in some way. Each contributed to at least one thing listed above in the development and history of cognitive neuropsychology.

Most computers have a large amount of space, but not infinite space. Also, most people are willing to wait a little while for a big calculation, but not forever. So if your problem is taking a long time but not much memory, a space-time tradeoff would let you use more memory and solve the problem more quickly. Or, if it could be solved very quickly but requires more memory than you have, you can try to spend more time solving the problem in the limited memory.\nThe most common condition is an algorithm using a lookup table. This means that the answers for some question for every possible value can be written down. One way of solving this problem is to write down the entire lookup table, which will let you find answers very quickly, but will use a lot of space. Another way is to calculate the answers without writing down anything, which uses very little space, but might take a long time.\nA space-time tradeoff can be used with the problem of data storage. If data is stored uncompressed, it takes more space but less time than if the data were stored compressed (since compressing the data decreases the amount of space it takes, but it takes time to run the compression algorithm).\nLarger code size can be used to increase program speed when using loop unwinding. This technique makes the program code longer for each iteration of a loop, but saves the computation time needed for jumping back to the beginning of the loop at the end of each iteration.\nIn the field of cryptography, using space-time tradeoff, the attacker is decreasing the exponential time required for a brute force attack. Rainbow tables use partially precomputed values in the hash space of a cryptographic hash function to crack passwords in minutes instead of weeks. Decreasing the size of the rainbow table increases the time required to iterate over the hash space. The meet-in-the-middle attack attack uses a space-time tradeoff to find the cryptographic key in only \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{n+1}}\n   encryptions (and \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(2^{n})}\n   space) compared to the expected \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            2\n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{2n}}\n   encryptions (but only \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(1)}\n   space) of the normal attack.\nDynamic programming is another example where the time of solving problems can be decreased by using more memory.\n\n\n== Other websites ==\nPhilippe Oechslin: Making a Faster Cryptanalytic Time-Memory Trade-Off.\nOnce Upon a Time-Memory Tradeoff.', 'Saint-Avit-Saint-Nazaire is a commune.

A calico cat has a coat of orange or brown and black spots on a white background. It is not a breed of cat.\nNearly all calico cats are female. There are male calico cats, but they are very rare.\n\n\n== Genetics ==\nA single X chromosome can have either a black allele of the coloration gene or an orange version, but not both. However, a female cat has two X chromosomes, so it can have both versions, black on one chromosome and orange on the other, making the cat a calico. A male cat usually has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. A Y chromosome does not have a color gene, so the cat can have either an orange or a black gene, but not both. Calico cats are often used as an example in biology classes when discussing sex chromosomes.\nDuring the early stages of development, when the cat is still an embryo, in each cell one of the X chromosomes (either the black one or the orange one) deactivates. It is called X-inactivation. All cells that were copied from a cell with a deactivated X chromosome will also have the same X chromosome deactivated. This is what leads to formation of the spots. The earlier in development the X chromosomes deactivate, the larger the spots will be. Deactivation of one of the X chromosomes happens in all female mammals. The white coloring on a calico is from a separate gene unrelated to the orange or black genes. Whether or not a cat is a calico is determined by genetics, but the actual layout of the spots is not. The layout of the spots is almost random. It is not possible to selectively breed or clone calico cats: an attempt to clone a calico cat will produce a black and white cat or orange and white tabby cat. The tortoiseshell cat is similar, although on a tortoiseshell cat the spots are usually smaller and closer together and there is less or no white. It is possible for a male cat to be a calico if it has Klinefelter\'s syndrome, where it has two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome, though not all cats with Klinefelter\'s syndrome are calico.\n\n\n== Folklore ==\nIn Japan, calico cats are said to bring good luck. In many Japanese shops there is a calico Japanese Bobtail figurine called the Maneki Neko, which is said to bring good luck to the shop\'s owner.\n\n\n== Famous calico cats ==\nA calico cat named Venus has recently made the news. Venus has a face that is exactly half-orange and half-black, with one green eye and one blue eye. Venus is sometimes incorrectly called a chimera cat, but is actually a calico.\nIn 1996, a calico cat saved her five kittens from a fire in an abandoned garage in New York City.
